Here it is in full (all names have been redacted): </p>\n\n<blockquote>From: Christopher Jordan Dorner /7648\n\n<p>To: America</p>\n\n<p>Subj: Last resort</p>\n\n<p>Regarding CF# 07-004281</p>\n\n<p>I know most of you who personally know me are in disbelief to hear from media reports that I am suspected of committing such horrendous murders and have taken drastic and shocking actions in the last couple of days. You are saying to yourself that this is completely out of character of the man you knew who always wore a smile wherever he was seen. I know I will be vilified by the LAPD and the media. Unfortunately, this is a necessary evil that I do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the LAPD and reclaim my name. The department has not changed since the Rampart and Rodney King days. It has gotten worse. The consent decree should never have been lifted. The only thing that has evolved from the consent decree is those officers involved in the Rampart scandal and Rodney King incidents have since promoted to supervisor, commanders, and command staff, and executive positions.</p>\n\n<p>The question is, what would you do to clear your name?</p>\n\n<p>Name;<br>\nA word or set of words by which a person, animal, place, or thing is known, addressed, or referred to.</p>\n\n<p>Name Synonyms;<br>\nreputation, title, appellation, denomination, repute.</p>\n\n<p>A name is more than just a noun, verb, or adjective. It&#x2019;s your life, your legacy, your journey, sacrifices, and everything you&#x2019;ve worked hard for every day of your life as and adolescent, young adult and adult. Don&#x2019;t let anybody tarnish it when you know you&#x2019;ve live up to your own set of ethics and personal ethos.</p>\n\n<p>In 8/07 I reported an officer (Ofcr. &#8212;&#8212;-/now a Sergeant), for kicking a suspect (excessive force) during a Use of Force while I was assigned as a patrol officer at LAPD&#x2019;s Harbor Division. While cuffing the suspect, (&#8212;&#8212;-), &#8212;&#8212;- kicked the suspect twice in the chest and once in the face. The kick to the face left a visible injury on the left cheek below the eye. Unfortunately after reporting it to supervisors and investigated by PSB (internal affairs investigator Det. &#8212;&#8212;-), nothing was done. I had broken their supposed &#x201C;Blue Line&#x201D;. Unfortunately, It&#x2019;s not JUST US, it&#x2019;s JUSTICE!!! In fact, 10 months later on 6/25/08, after already successfully completing probation, acquiring a basic Post Certificate, and Intermediate Post Certificate, I was relieved of duty by the LAPD while assigned to patrol at Southwest division. It is clear as day that the department retaliated toward me for reporting &#8212;&#8212;- for kicking Mr. &#8212;&#8212;-. The department stated that I had lied and made up the report that &#8212;&#8212;- had kicked the suspect. I later went to a Board of Rights (department hearing for decision of continued employment) from 10/08 to 1/09. During this BOR hearing a video was played for the BOR panel where &#8212;&#8212;- stated that he was indeed kicked by Officer &#8212;&#8212;- (video sent to multiple news agencies). In addition to &#8212;&#8212;- stating he was kicked, his father &#8212;&#8212;-, also stated that his son had stated he was kicked by an officer when he was arrested after being released from custody. This was all presented for the department at the BOR hearing. They still found me guilty and terminated me. What they didn&#x2019;t mention was that the BOR panel made up of Capt. &#8212;&#8212;-, Capt. &#8212;&#8212;-, and City Attorney &#8212;&#8212;- had a significant problem from the time the board was assembled. Capt. &#8212;&#8212;- was a personal friend of &#8212;&#8212;- from when he was her supervisor at Harbor station. That is a clear conflict of interest and I made my argument for his removal early and was denied. The advocate for the LAPD BOR was Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;-. &#8212;&#8212;- also had a conflict of interest as she was &#8212;&#8212;- friend and former partner from Harbor division where they both worked patrol together. I made my argument for her removal when I discovered her relation to &#8212;&#8212;- and it was denied.</p>\n\n<p>During the BOR, the department attempted to label me unsuccessfully as a bully. They stated that I had bullied a recruit, &#8212;&#8212;-, in the academy when in reality and unfounded disposition from the official 1.28 formal complaint investigation found that I was the one who stood up for &#8212;&#8212;- when other recruits sang nazi hitler youth songs about burning Jewish ghettos in WWII Germany where his father was a survivor of a concentration camp. How fucking dare you attempt to label me with such a nasty vile word. I ask that all earnest journalist investigating this story ask Ofcr. &#8212;&#8212;- about the incident when Ofcr. &#8212;&#8212;- began singing a nazi youth song about burning jewish ghettos.</p>\n\n<p>The internal affairs investigation in the academy involving &#8212;&#8212;- was spurned by a complaint that I had initiated toward two fellow recruit/offifcers. While assigned patrol footbeat in Hollywood Division, Officers &#8212;&#8212;- and &#8212;&#8212;- (both current LAPD officers) decided that they would voice their personal feelings about the black community. While traveling back to the station in a 12 passenger van I heard &#8212;&#8212;- refer to another individual as a nigger. I wasn&#x2019;t sure if I heard correctly as there were many conversations in the van that was compiled of at least 8 officers and he was sitting in the very rear and me in the very front. Even with the multiple conversations and ambient noise I heard Officer &#8212;&#8212;- call an indivdual a nigger again. Now that I had confirmed it, I told &#8212;&#8212;- not to use that word again. I explained that it was a well-known offensive word that should not be used by anyone. He replied, &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll say it when I want&#x201D;. Officer &#8212;&#8212;-, a friend of his, also stated that he would say nigger when he wanted. At that point I jumped over my front passenger seat and two other officers where I placed my hands around &#8212;&#8212;-&#x2019; neck and squeezed. I stated to &#8212;&#8212;-, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t fucking say that&#x201D;. At that point there was pushing and shoving and we were separated by several other officers. What I should have done, was put a Winchester Ranger SXT 9mm 147 grain bullet in his skull and Officer &#8212;&#8212;-&#x2019;s skull. The Situation would have been resolved effective, immediately. The sad thing about this incident was that when Detective &#8212;&#8212;- from internal affairs investigated this incident only (1) officer (unknown) in the van other than myself had statements constistent with what actually happened. The other six officers  all stated they heard nothing and saw nothing. Shame on every one of you. Shame on Detective &#8212;&#8212;- (same ethnicity as &#8212;&#8212;-) for creating a separate 1.28 formal complaint against me (&#8212;&#8212;- complaint) in retaliation for initiating the complaint against &#8212;&#8212;- and &#8212;&#8212;-. Don&#x2019;t retaliate against honest officers for breaking your so-called blue line. I hope your son &#8212;&#8212;-, who I knew, is a better officer than you, Detective &#8212;&#8212;-. The saddest part of this ordeal was that Officer &#8212;&#8212;- and &#8212;&#8212;- were only given 22 day suspensions and are still LAPD officers to this day. That day, the LAPD stated that it is acceptable for fellow officers to call black officers niggers to their face and you will receive a slap on the wrist. Even sadder is that during that 22 day suspension &#8212;&#8212;- and &#8212;&#8212;- received is that the LAPPL (Los Angeles Police Protective League) paid the officers their salaries while they were suspended. When I took a two-day suspension for an accidental discharge, I took my suspension and never applied for a league salary. Its called integrity.</p>\n\n<p>Journalist, I want you to investigate every location I resided in growing up. Find any incidents where I was ever accused of being a bully. You won&#x2019;t, because it doesn&#x2019;t exist. It&#x2019;s not in my DNA. Never was. I was the only black kid in each of my elementary school classes from first grade to seventh grade in junior high and any instances where I was disciplined for fighting was in response to fellow students provoking common childhood schoolyard fights, or calling me a nigger or other derogatory racial names. I grew up in neighborhoods where blacks make up less than 1%. My first recollection of racism was in the first grade at Norwalk Christian elementary school in Norwalk, CA. A fellow student, &#8212;&#8212;- if I can recall, called me a nigger on the playground. My response was swift and non-lethal. I struck him fast and hard with a punch an kick. He cried and reported it to a teacher. The teacher reported it to the principal. The principal swatted &#8212;&#8212;- for using a derogatory word toward me. He then for some unknown reason swatted me for striking &#8212;&#8212;- in response to him calling me a nigger. He stated as good Christians we are to turn the other cheek as Jesus did. Problem is, I&#x2019;m not a fucking Christian and that old book, made of fiction and limited non-fiction, called the bible, never once stated Jesus was called a nigger. How dare you swat me for standing up for my rights for demanding that I be treated as an equal human being. That day I made a life decision that i will not tolerate racial derogatory terms spoken to me. Unfortunately I was swatted multiple times for the same exact reason up until junior high. Terminating me for telling the truth of a Caucasian officer kicking a mentally ill man is disgusting. Don&#x2019;t ever call me a fucking bully. I want all journalist to utilize every source you have that specializes in collections for your reports. With the discovery and evidence available you will see the truth. Unfortunately, I will not be alive to see my name cleared. That&#x2019;s what this is about, my name. A man is nothing without his name. Below is a list of locations where I resided from childhood to adulthood.</p>\n\n<p>Cerritos, CA.<br>\nPico Rivera, CA.<br>\nLa Palma, CA.<br>\nThousand Oaks, CA.<br>\nCedar City, UT.<br>\nPensacola, FL.<br>\nEnid, OK.<br>\nYorba Linda, CA.<br>\nLas Vegas, NV.</p>\n\n<p>During the BOR an officer named, Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;-, from Los Angeles Port Police testified on behalf of the LAPD. &#8212;&#8212;- stated for the BOR that he arrived at the location of the UOF shortly before I cuffed the suspect. He also stated that he assisted in cuffing the suspect and that&#x2019;s old the BOR he told me to fix my tie. All of those statements were LIES!!! &#8212;&#8212;-, you arrived at the UOF location up to 30 seconds after I had cuffed Mr.&#8212;&#8212;-. All you did was help me lift the suspect to his feet as it was difficult for me to do by myself because of his heavy weight. You did not tell me to fix my tie as the BOR members and everyone else in the room know you lied because the photographic evidence from the UOF scene where &#8212;&#8212;-&#x2019;s injuries were photographed clearly shows me wearing a class B uniform on that day. A class B uniform is a short sleeved uniform blouse. A short sleeved uniform blouse for the LAPD does not have a tie included. This is not Super Troopers uniform, you jackass. Why did you feel the need to embellish and lie about your involvement in the UOF? Are you ashamed that you could not get hired on by any other department other than port police? Do you have delusions of grandeur? What you did was perjury, exactly what &#8212;&#8212;- did when she stated she did not kick &#8212;&#8212;-.</p>\n\n<p>What they failed to mention in the BOR was &#8212;&#8212;- own use of force history during her career on the LAPD. She has admitted that she has a lengthy use of force record and has been flagged several times by risk management. She has a very well known nickname, Chupacabra, which she was very proud to flaunt around the division. She found it very funny and entertaining to draw blood from suspects and arrestees. At one point she even intentionally ripped the flesh off the arm of a woman we had arrested for battery (sprayed her neighbor with a garden water hose). Knowing the woman had thin elastic skin, she performed and Indian burn to the woman&#x2019;s arm after cuffing her. That woman was in her mid-70&#x2019;s, a mother and grandmother, and was angry at her tenants who failed to pay rent on time. Something I can completely understand and I am sure many have wanted to do toward tenants who do not pay their rent. &#8212;&#8212;- was also demoted from a senior lead officer rank/position for performance issues. During my two months of working patrol with &#8212;&#8212;-, I found her as a woman who was very angry that she had been pulled from patrol for a short time because of a domestic violence report made by Long Beach Police Department because of an incident involving her active LAPD officer boyfriend, &#8212;&#8212;-, and herself. &#8212;&#8212;- is the same officer investigated for witness tampering. She also was visibly angry on a daily basis that she was going to have to file for bankruptcy because her ex-husband, a former LAPD officer and not &#8212;&#8212;-, who had left the department, state, and was nowhere to be found had left her with a tax bill and debt that she was unable to pay because of a lack of financial means. &#8212;&#8212;-, you are a POS and you lied right to the BOR panel when &#8212;&#8212;- asked you if you kicked &#8212;&#8212;-. You destroyed my life and name because of your actions. Time is up. The time is now to confess to &#8212;&#8212;-.</p>\n\n<p>I ask that all journalist investigating this story submit request for FOIA with the LAPD to gain access to the BOR transcripts which occurred from 10/08 to 2/09. There, you will see that a video was played for the BOR members of Mr. &#8212;&#8212;- who suffers from Schizophrenia and Dementia stating that he was kicked by a female officer. That video evidence supports my claim that &#8212;&#8212;- kicked him twice in the upper body and once in the face. I would like all journalist to also request copies of all reports that I had written while employed by LAPD. Whether in the academy, or during my 3 years as a police officer. There are DR#&#x2019;s attached to each report (investigative report) that I have ever written so they all exist. A FOIA request will most likely be needed to access these at Parker center or at the Personnel/Records. Judge my writin/grammar skills for yourself. The department attempted to paint me as an officer who could not write reports. Even though Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;- a training officer who trained me stated for the BOR panel that there was nothing wrong with my report writing and that I was better than all rookie/probationer officers he has ever trained. Officer &#8212;&#8212;- stated the same but refused to testify as he did not want to &#x201C;get involved&#x201D; with the BOR&#x2019;s. Contact Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;-,(now a Captain at Lompoc PD), Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;-, and Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;-. All will state that my report writing was impeccable. I will tell you this, I always type my reports because I have messy handwriting/penmanship. I never had a single kickback/redlined report at Southwest division and Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;- and Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;- can testify to that. I never received an UNSATISFACTORY on any day or week. The same can be said within the U.S. Naval Reserves. All commanders will state that my report writing was always clear, concise, and impeccable. Even search my AAR (after action reports),chits, Memorandum&#x2019;s, IIR&#x2019;s (Intelligence Information Reports) which were written in the Navy. All were pristine.</p>\n\n<p>I had worked patrol at LAPD&#x2019;s Harbor Division from 2/06 until 7/06 when I was involuntarily recalled back to active duty (US Navy) for a 12 month mobilization/deployment to Centcom in support of OIF/OEF. I returned back to LAPD&#x2019;s Harbor division on 7/07 and immediately returned to patrol. I worked at Harbor division until 11/07 where I then transferred to Southwest Division. I worked At Southwest division until 6/25/08 when I was relieved of duty.</p>\n\n<p>I have exhausted all available means at obtaining my name back. I have attempted all legal court efforts within appeals at the Superior Courts and California Appellate courts. This is my last resort. The LAPD has suppressed the truth and it has now lead to deadly consequences. The LAPD&#x2019;s actions have cost me my law enforcement career that began on 2/7/05 and ended on 1/2/09. They cost me my Naval career which started on 4/02 and ends on 2/13. I had a TS/SCI clearance(Top Secret Sensitive Compartmentalized Information clearance) up until shortly after my termination with LAPD. This is the highest clearance a service member can attain other than a Yankee White TS/SCI which is only granted for those working with and around the President/Vice President of the United States. I lost my position as a Commanding Officer of a Naval Security Forces reserve unit at NAS Fallon because of the LAPD. I&#x2019;ve lost a relationship with my mother and sister because of the LAPD. I&#x2019;ve lost a relationship with close friends because of the LAPD. In essence, I&#x2019;ve lost everything because the LAPD took my name and new I was INNOCENT!!!  &#8212;&#8212;-, &#8212;&#8212;-, &#8212;&#8212;-,&#8212;&#8212;- and &#8212;&#8212;- all new I was innocent but decided to terminate me so they could continue Ofcr. &#8212;&#8212;-. I know about the meeting between all of you where &#8212;&#8212;- attorney, &#8212;&#8212;-, confessed that she kicked &#8212;&#8212;- (excessive force). Your day has come.</p>\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m not an aspiring rapper, I&#x2019;m not a gang member, I&#x2019;m not a dope dealer, I don&#x2019;t have multiple babies momma&#x2019;s. I am an American by choice, I am a son, I am a brother, I am a military service member, I am a man who has lost complete faith in the system, when the system betrayed, slandered, and libeled me. I lived a good life and though not a religious man I always stuck to my own personal code of ethics, ethos and always stuck to my shoreline and true North. I didn&#x2019;t need the US Navy to instill Honor, Courage, and Commitment in me but I thank them for re-enforcing it. It&#x2019;s in my DNA.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily I don&#x2019;t have to live everyday like most of you. Concerned if the misconduct you were apart of is going to be discovered. Looking over your shoulder, scurrying at every phone call from internal affairs or from the Captains office wondering if that is the day PSB comes after you for the suspects you struck when they were cuffed months/years ago or that $500 you pocketed from the narcotics dealer, or when the other guys on your watch beat a transient nearly to death and you never reported the UOF to the supervisor. No, I don&#x2019;t have that concern, I stood up for what was right but unfortunately have dealt with the reprocussions of doing the right thing and now losing my name and everything I ever stood for. You fuckers knew &#8212;&#8212;- was guilty of kicking (excessive force) &#8212;&#8212;- and you did nothing but get rid of what you saw as the problem, the whistleblower. &#8212;&#8212;- himself stated on video tape ( provided for the BOR and in transcripts) he was kicked and even his father stated that his son said he was kicked by &#8212;&#8212;- when he was released from custody. The video was played for the entire BOR to hear. You&#x2019;re going to see what a whistleblower can do when you take everything from him especially his NAME!!!</p>\n\n<p>Look what you did to Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;- (now lieutenant) when he exposed the truth of your lying, racism, and PSB cover-ups to frame and convict an innocent man. You can not police yourselves and the consent decree was unsuccessful. Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;-, I met you on the range several times as a recruit and as an officer. You&#x2019;re a good man and I saw it in your eyes an actions.</p>\n\n<p>Self Preservation is no longer important to me. I do not fear death as I died long ago on 1/2/09. I was told by my mother that sometimes bad things happen to good people. I refuse to accept that.</p>\n\n<p>From 2/05 to 1/09 I saw some of the most vile things humans can inflict on others as a police officer in Los Angeles. Unfortunately, it wasn&#x2019;t in the streets of LA. It was in the confounds of LAPD police stations and shops (cruisers). The enemy combatants in LA are not the citizens and suspects, it&#x2019;s the police officers.</p>\n\n<p>People who live in glass houses should not throw stones. How ironic that you utilize a fixed glass structure as your command HQ. You use as a luminous building to symbolize that you are transparent, have nothing to hide, or suppress when in essence, concealing, omitting, and obscuring is your forte.</p>\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-, this is when you need to have that come to Jesus talk with Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;- and everyone else who was involved in the conspiracy to have me terminated for doing the right thing. you also need to speak with her attorney, &#8212;&#8212;-, and his conversation with the BOR members and her confession of guilt in kicking Mr. &#8212;&#8212;-. I&#x2019;ll be waiting for a PUBLIC response at a press conference. When the truth comes out, the killing stops.</p>\n\n<p>Why didn&#x2019;t you charge me with filing a false police report when I came forward stating that &#8212;&#8212;- kicked Mr. &#8212;&#8212;-? You file criminal charges against every other officer who is accused and terminated for filing a false police report. You didn&#x2019;t because you knew I was innocent and a criminal court would find me innocent and expose your department for suppressing the truth and retaliation, that&#x2019;s why.</p>\n\n<p>The attacks will stop when the department states the truth about my innocence, PUBLICLY!!! I will not accept any type of currency/goods in exchange for the attacks to stop, nor do i want it. I want my name back, period. There is no negotiation. I am not the state department who states they do not negotiate with terrorist, because anybody with a Secret or TS/SCI has seen IIR&#x2019;s on SIPR and knows that the US state department always negotiates by using CF countries or independent sovereign/neutral country to mediate and compromising.</p>\n\n<p>This department has not changed from the &#8212;&#8212;- and &#8212;&#8212;- days. Those officers are still employed and have all promoted to Command staff and supervisory positions. I will correct this error. Are you aware that an officer (a rookie/probationer at the time) seen on the Rodney King videotape striking Mr. King multiple times with a baton on 3/3/91 is still employed by the LAPD and is now a Captain on the police department? Captain &#8212;&#8212;- is now the commanding officer of a LAPD police station (West LA division). As a commanding officer, he is now responsible for over 200 officers. Do you trust him to enforce department policy and investigate use of force investigations on arrestees by his officers? Are you aware &#8212;&#8212;- has since promoted to Sergeant after kicking Mr. &#8212;&#8212;- in the face. Oh, you Violated a citizens civil rights? We will promote you. Same as LAPD did with the officers from Metro involved in the May Day melee at MacArthur Park. They promoted them to Sergeant (a supervisor role).</p>\n\n<p>No one is saying you can&#x2019;t be prejudiced or a bigot. We are all human and hold prejudices. If you state that you don&#x2019;t have prejudices, your lying! But, when you act on it and victimize innocent citizens and fellow innocen officers, than that is a concern.</p>\n\n<p>For you officers who do the job in the name of JUSTICE, those of you who lost honest officers to this event, look at the name of those on the BOR and the investigating officers from PSB and &#8212;&#8212;- and ask them, how come you couldn&#x2019;t tell the truth? Why did you terminate an honest officer and cover for a dishonest officer who victimized a mentally ill citizen.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes humans feel a need to prove they are the dominant race of a species and they inadvertently take kindness for weakness from another individual. You chose wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Terminating officers because they expose a culture of lying, racism (from the academy), and excessive use of force will immediately change. PSB can not police their own and that has been proven. The blue line will forever be severed and a cultural change will be implanted. You have awoken a sleeping giant.</p>\n\n<p>I am here to change and make policy. The culture of LAPD versus the community and honest/good officers needs to and will change. I am here to correct and calibrate your morale compasses to true north.</p>\n\n<p>Those Caucasian officers who join South Bureau divisions (77th,SW,SE, an Harbor) with the sole intent to victimize minorities who are uneducated, and unaware of criminal law, civil law, and civil rights. You prefer the South bureau because a use of force/deadly force is likely and the individual you use UOF on will likely not report it. You are a high value target.</p>\n\n<p>Those Black officers in supervisory ranks and pay grades who stay in south bureau (even though you live in the valley or OC) for the sole intent of getting retribution toward subordinate caucasians officers for the pain and hostile work environment their elders inflicted on you as probationers (P-1&#x2032;s) and novice P-2&#x2019;s. You are a high value target. You perpetuated the cycle of racism in the department as well. You breed a new generation of bigoted caucasian officer when you belittle them and treat them unfairly.</p>\n\n<p>Those Hispanic officers who victimize their own ethnicity because they are new immigrants to this country and are unaware of their civil rights. You call them wetbacks to their face and demean them in front of fellow officers of different ethnicities so that you will receive some sort of acceptance from your colleagues. I&#x2019;m not impressed. Most likely, your parents or grandparents were immigrants at one time, but you have forgotten that. You are a high value target.</p>\n\n<p>Those lesbian officers in supervising positions who go to work, day in day out, with the sole intent of attempting to prove your misandrist authority (not feminism) to degrade male officers. You are a high value target.</p>\n\n<p>Those Asian officers who stand by and observe everything I previously mentioned other officers participate in on a daily basis but you say nothing, stand for nothing and protect nothing. Why? Because of your usual saying, &#x201D; I&#x2026;&#x2026;don&#x2019;t like conflict&#x201D;. You are a high value target as well.</p>\n\n<p>Those of you who &#x201C;go along to get along&#x201D; have no backbone and destroy the foundation of courage. You are the enablers of those who are guilty of misconduct. You are just as guilty as those who break the code of ethics and oath you swore.</p>\n\n<p>Citizens/non-combatants, do not render medical aid to downed officers/enemy combatants. They would not do the same for you. They will let you bleed out just so they can brag to other officers that they had a 187 caper the other day and can&#x2019;t wait to accrue the overtime in future court subpoenas. As they always say, &#x201C;that&#x2019;s the paramedics job&#x2026;not mine&#x201D;. Let the balance of loss of life take place. Sometimes a reset needs to occur.</p>\n\n<p>It is endless the amount of times per week officers arrest an individual, label him a suspect-arrestee-defendant and then before arraignment or trial realize that he is innocent based on evidence. You know what they say when they realize an innocent man just had his life turned upside down?. &#x201C;I guess he should have stayed at home that day he was discovered walking down the street and matching the suspects description. Oh well, he appeared to be a dirtbag anyways&#x201D;. Meanwhile the falsely accused is left to pick up his life, get a new, family, friends, and sense of self worth.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#x2019;t honor these fallen officers/dirtbags. When your family members die, they just see you as extra overtime at a crime scene and at a perimeter. Why would you value their lives when they clearly don&#x2019;t value yours or your family members lives? I&#x2019;ve heard many officers who state they see dead victims as ATV&#x2019;s, Waverunners, RV&#x2019;s and new clothes for their kids. Why would you shed a tear for them when they in return crack a smile for your loss because of the impending extra money they will receive in their next paycheck for sitting at your loved ones crime scene of 6 hours because of the overtime they will accrue. They take photos of your loved ones recently deceased bodies with their cellphones and play a game of who has the most graphic dead body of the night with officers from other divisions. This isn&#x2019;t just the 20 something year old officers, this is the 50 year old officers with significant time on the job as well who participate.</p>\n\n<p>You allow an officer, &#8212;&#8212;-, to attempt to hack into my credit union account and still remain on the job even when Det. &#8212;&#8212;- shows the evidence that the IP address (provided by LAPFCU) that attempted to hack into my account and change my username and password leads directly to her residence. You even allow this visibly disgusting looking officer to stay on the job when she perjures (lies) in court (Clark County Family Court) to the judge&#x2019;s face and denies hacking into my personal credit union online account when I attempted to get my restraint order extended. Det. &#8212;&#8212;- provided the evidence and you still do nothing.</p>\n\n<p>How do you know when a police officer is lying??? When he begins his sentence with, &#x201C;based on my experience and training&#x201D;.</p>\n\n<p>No one grows up and wants to be a cop killer. It was against everything I&#x2019;ve ever was. As a young police explorer I found my calling in life. But, As a young police officer I found that the violent suspects on the street are not the only people you have to watch. It is the officer who was hired on to the department (pre-2000) before polygraphs were standard for all new hires and a substantial vetting in a backround investigation.</p>\n\n<p>To those children of the officers who are eradicated, your parent was not the individual you thought they were. As you get older,you will see the evidence that your parent was a tyrant who loss their ethos and instead followed the path of moral corruptness. They conspired to hide and suppress the truth of misconduct on others behalf&#x2019;s. Your parent will have a name and plaque on the fallen officers memorial in D.C. But, In all honesty, your parents name will be a reminder to other officers to maintain the oath they swore and to stay along the shoreline that has guided them from childhood to that of a local, state, or federal law enforcement officer.</p>\n\n<p>Your lack of ethics and conspiring to wrong a just individual are over.<br>\nSuppressing the truth will leave to deadly consequences for you and your family. There will be an element of surprise where you work, live, eat, and sleep. I will utilize ISR at your home, workplace, and all locations in between. I will utilize OSINT to discover your residences, spouses workplaces, and children&#x2019;s schools. IMINT to coordinate and plan attacks on your fixed locations. Its amazing whats on NIPR. HUMINT will be utilized to collect personal schedules of targets. I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own, I&#x2019;m terminating yours. &#8212;&#8212;-, &#8212;&#8212;-, &#8212;&#8212;-, and BOR members Look your wives/husbands and surviving children directly in the face and tell them the truth as to why your children are dead.</p>\n\n<p>Never allow a LAPPL union attorney to be a retired LAPD Captain,(&#8212;&#8212;-). He doesn&#x2019;t work for you, your interest, or your name. He works for the department, period. His job is to protect the department from civil lawsuits being filed and their best interest which is the almighty dollar. His loyalty is to the department, not his client. Even when he knowingly knows your innocent and the BOR also knows your innocent after &#8212;&#8212;- stated on videotape that he was kicked and &#8212;&#8212;- attorney confessed to the BOR off the record that she kicked &#8212;&#8212;-.</p>\n\n<p>The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants-TJ. This quote is not directed toward the US government which I fully support 100%. This is toward the LAPD who can not monitor itself. The consent decree should not have been lifted, ever.</p>\n\n<p>I know your TTP&#x2019;s, (techniques, tactics, and procedures). Any threat assessments you generate will be useless. This is simple, I know your TTP&#x2019;s and PPR&#x2019;s. I will mitigate any of your attempts at preservation. ORM is my friend. I will mitigate all risks, threats and hazards. I assure you that Incident Command Posts will be target rich environments. KMA-367 license plate frames are great target indicators and make target selection even easier.</p>\n\n<p>I will conduct DA operations to destroy, exploit and seize designated targets. If unsuccessful or unable to meet objectives in these initial small-scale offensive actions, I will reassess my BDA and re-attack until objectives are met. I have nothing to lose. My personal casualty means nothing. Just alike AAF&#x2019;s, ACM&#x2019;s, and AIF&#x2019;s, you can not prevail against an enemy combatant who has no fear of death. An enemy who embraces death is a lose, lose situation for their enemy combatants.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully you analyst have done your homework. You are aware that I have always been the top shot, highest score, an expert in rifle qualifications in every unit I&#x2019;ve been in. I will utilize every bit of small arms training, demolition, ordnance, and survival training I&#x2019;ve been given.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know why we are unsuccessful in asymmetrical and guerrilla warfare in CENTCOM theatre of operations? I&#x2019;ll tell you. It&#x2019;s not the inefficiency of our combatant commanders, planning, readiness or training of troops. Much like the Vietnam war, ACM, AAF, foreign fighters, Jihadist, and JAM have nothing to lose. They embrace death as it is a way of life. I simply don&#x2019;t fear it. I am the walking exigent circumstance you created.</p>\n\n<p>The Violence of action will be HIGH. I am the reason TAC alert was established. I will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty. ISR is my strength and your weakness. You will now live the life of the prey. Your RD&#x2019;s and homes away from work will be my AO and battle space. I will utilize every tool within INT collections that I learned from NMITC in Dam Neck. You have misjudged a sleeping giant. There is no conventional threat assessment for me. JAM, New Ba&#x2019;ath party, 1920 rev BGE, ACM, AAF, AQAP, AQIM and AQIZ have nothing on me. Do not deploy airships or gunships. SA-7 Manpads will be waiting. As you know I also own Barrett .50&#x2032;s so your APC are defunct and futile.</p>\n\n<p>You better have all your officers radio/phone muster (code 1) on or off duty every hour, on the hour.<br>\nDo not attempt to shadow or conduct any type of ISR on me. I have the inventory listing of all UC vehicles at Piper Tech and the home addresses of any INT analyst at JRIC and detachment locations. My POA is always POI and always true. This will be a war of attrition and a Pyrrhic and Camdean Victory for myself. You may have the resources and manpower but you are reactive and predictable in your op plans and TTP&#x2019;s. I have the strength and benefits of being unpredictable, unconventional, and unforgiving. Do not waste your time with briefs and tabletops.</p>\n\n<p>Whatever pre-planned responses you have established for a scenario like me, shelve it. Whatever contingency plan you have, shelve it. Whatever tertiary plan you&apos;ve created, shelve it. I am a walking exigent circumstance with no OFF or reset button. JRIC, DOJ, LASD, FBI and other local LE can&apos;t assist and should not involve themselves in a matter that does not concern them. For all other agencies, do not involve yourself in this capture or recovery of me. Look at the big picture of the situation. They (LAPD) created the situation. I will harm no outside agency unless it is a deadly force/IDOL situation. With today&apos;s budgeting and fiscal mess, you guys can not afford lose several officers to IOD or KIA/EOW. Plus, other officers should not have to take on the additional duties and responsibilities of dead officers. Think about their families, outside agencies, Chiefs/Directors.</p>\n\n<p>Outside agencies and individual officers on patrol. If you recognize my vehicle, and confirm it is my vehicle thru a dmv/want warrant check. It behoves you to respond to dispatch that your query was for information purposes only. If you proceed with a traffic stop or attempt to notify other officers of my location or for backup you will not live to see the medal of valor you were hoping to receive for your actions. Think before you attempt to intervene. You will not survive. Your family will receive that medal of valor posthumously. It will gather dust on the fireplace mantel for years. Then one day, it will go in a shoe box with other memories. Your mother will lose a son or daughter. Your significant other will be left alone, but they will find someone else to fill your void in the future and make them just as happy. Your children, if you have them, will call someone else mommy or daddy. Don&apos;t be selfish. Your vest is only a level II or IIIA, think about it.</p>\n\n<p>No amount of IMINT, MASINT, and ELINT assist you in capturing me. I am off the grid. You better use your feet, tongue and every available DOD/ NON-DOD HUMINT agency, contractor to find me. I know your route to and from home, and your division. I know your significant others routine, your children&apos;s best friends and recess. I know Your Sancha&apos;s gym hours and routine. I assure you that the casualty rate will be high. Because of that, no one will remember your name. You will merely be a DR# and &quot;that guy&quot; who was KIA/EOW or long term IOD/light duty in the kit room. This is exactly why &quot;station 500&#x2033; was created. Unfortunately, orphanages will be making a comeback in the 21st century.</p>\n\n<p>The Violence of action will be HIGH. I am the reason TAC alert was established. I will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty.<br>\nIf you had a well regulated AWB, this would not happen. The time is now to reinstitute a ban that will save lives. Why does any sportsman need a 30 round magazine for hunting? Why does anyone need a suppressor? Why does anyone need a AR15 rifle? This is the same small arms weapons system utilized in eradicating Al Qaeda, Taliban, and every enemy combatant since the Vietnam war. Don&apos;t give me that crap that its not a select fire or full auto rifle like the DoD uses. That&apos;s bullshit because troops who carry the M-4/M-16 weapon system for combat ops outside the wire rarely utilize the select fire function when in contact with enemy combatants. The use of select fire probably isn&apos;t even 1% in combat. So in essence, the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle is the same as the M-4/M-16. These do not need to be purchased as easily as walking to your local Walmart or striking the enter key on your keyboard to &quot;add to cart&quot;. All the firearms utilized in my activities are registered to me and were legally purchased at gun stores and private party transfers. All concealable weapons (pistols) were also legally register in my name at police stations or FFL&apos;s. Unfortunately, are you aware that I obtained class III weapons (suppressors) without a background check thru NICS or DROS completely LEGALLY several times? I was able to use a trust account that I created on quicken will maker and a $10 notary charge at a mailbox etc. to obtain them legally. Granted, I am not a felon, nor have a DV misdemeanor conviction or active TRO against me on a NCIC file. I can buy any firearm I want, but should I be able to purchase these class III weapons (SBR&apos;s, and suppressors) without a background check and just a $10 notary signature on a quicken will maker program? The answer is NO. I&apos;m not even a resident of the state i purchased them in. Lock n Load just wanted money so they allow you to purchase class III weapons with just a notarized trust, military ID. Shame on you, Lock n Load. NFA and ATF need new laws and policies that do not allow loopholes such as this. In the end, I hope that you will realize that the small arms I utilize should not be accessed with the ease that I obtained them. Who in there right mind needs a fucking silencer!!! who needs a freaking SBR AR15? No one. No more Virginia Tech, Columbine HS, Wisconsin temple, Aurora theatre, Portland malls, Tucson rally, Newtown Sandy Hook. Whether by executive order or thru a bi-partisan congress an assault weapons ban needs to be re-instituted. Period!!!</p>\n\n<p>Mia Farrow said it best. &quot;Gun control is no longer debatable, it&apos;s not a conversation, its a moral mandate.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Sen. Feinstein, you are doing the right thing in leading the re-institution of a national AWB. Never again should any public official state that their prayers and thoughts are with the family. That has become cliche&apos; and meaningless. Its time for action. Let this be your legacy that you bestow to America. Do not be swayed by obstacles, antagaonist, and naysayers. Remember the innocent children at Austin, Kent, Stockton, Fullerton, San Diego, Iowa City, Jonesboro, Columbine, Nickel Mines, Blacksburg, Springfield, Red Lake, Chardon, Aurora, and Newtown. Make sure this never happens again!!!</p>\n\n<p>In my cache you will find several small arms. In the cache, Bushmaster firearms, Remington precision rifles, and AAC Suppressors (silencers). All of these small arms are manufactured by Cerberus/Freedom Group. The same company responsible for the Portland mall shooting, Webster , NY, and Sandy Hook massacre.</p>\n\n<p>You disrespect the office of the POTUS/Presidency and Commander in Chief. You call him Kenyan, mongroid, halfrican, muslim, and FBHO when in essence you are to address him as simply, President. The same as you did to President George W. Bush and all those in the highest ranking position of our land before him. Just as I always have. You question his birth certificate, his educational and professional accomplishments, and his judeo-christian beliefs. You make disparaging remarks about his dead parents. You never questioned the fact that his former opponent, the honorable Senator John McCain, was not born in the CONUS or that Bush had a C average in his undergrad. Electoral Candidates children (Romney) state they want to punch the president in the face during debates with no formal repercussions. No one even questioned the fact that the son just made a criminal threat toward the President. You call his wife a Wookie. Off the record, I love your new bangs, Mrs. Obama. A woman whose professional and educational accomplishments are second to none when compared to recent First wives. You call his supporters, whether black, brown, yellow, or white, leeches, FSA, welfare recipients, and ni$&amp;er lovers. You say this openly without any discretion. Before you start with your argument that you believe I would vote for Obama because he has the same skin color as me, fuck you. I didn&apos;t vote in this last election as my choice of candidate, John Huntsman, didn&apos;t win the primary candidacy for his party. Mr. President, I haven&apos;t agreed with all of your decisions but of course I haven&apos;t agreed with all of your predecessors decisions. I think you&apos;ve done a hell of a job with what you have been dealt and how you have managed it. I shed a tear the night you were initially elected President in 2008. I never thought that day would occur. A black man elected president in the U.S. in my lifetime. I cracked a smiled when you were re-elected in 2012 because I really didn&apos;t think you were going to pull that one off. Romney, stop being a sore loser. You could&apos;ve exited graciously and still contributed significantly to public service, not now. Mr. President, get back to work. Many want to see you fail as they have stated so many times previously. Unfortunately, if you fail, the U.S. fails but your opponents do not concern themselves about the big picture. Do not forget your commitment to transparency in your administration. Sometimes I believe your administration forgets that. America, you will realize today and tomorrow that this world is made up of all human beings who have the same general needs and wants in life for themselves, their kin, community, and state. That is the freedom to LIVE and LOVE. They may eat different foods, enjoy different music, have different dialects, or speak a second language, but in essence are no different from you and I. This is America. We are not a perfect sovereign country as we have our own flaws but we are the closest that will ever exist.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, this is not the first time an authoritative figure has lied on me.</p>\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-, assistant principal, Cypress HS. Remember when you lied to my mother and the police officer in your office about stating that you never stated to me in a private conversation that you know the theft suspect (&#8212;&#8212;-) stole my watch. Let me refresh your memory. A physical education teachers assistant, a student, stole the list of combination codes to peoples lockers, from the P.E. teacher. That student then opened many of those lockers and stole students personal property. My watch was taken in that multi theft an I reported it to you. A week later you discovered that the theft suspect was &#8212;&#8212;-, a student. You stated to me in private that you know for a fact he stole my property. When I attempted to retrieve my property from the suspect. Campus security was called and you lied and stated that you never stated to me that you &quot;know he stole my watch&quot;. You sat there and lied to their faces right in front of me. You said it with such a deliberate, stern face. I never forgot that and was not surprised when 13 years later I was lied on again in the BOR by &#8212;&#8212;-. maybe you can confess to your family at the very least in the private of your own home. After that, contact my mother and apologize for lying to her in 1996.</p>\n\n<p>If possible, I want my brain preserved for science/research to study the effects of severe depression on an individual&apos;s brain. Since 6/26/08 when I was relieved of duty and 1/2/09 when I was terminated I have been afflicted with severe depression. I&apos;ve had two CT scans during my lifetime that are in my medical record at Kaiser Permanente. Both are from concussions resulting from playing football. The first one was in high school, 10/96. The second was in college and occurred in 10/99. Both were conducted at Kaiser Permanente hospitals in LA/Orange county. These two CT scans should give a good baseline for my brain activity before severe depression began in late 2008.</p>\n\n<p>Sure, many of you &quot;law enforcement experts and specialist&quot; will state, &quot;in all my years this is the worst........&quot;, Stop!!! That&apos;s not important. Ask yourselves what would cause somebody to take these drastic measures like I did. That&apos;s what is important.</p>\n\n<p>To my friends listed below, I wish we could have grown old together and spent more time together. When you reminisce of our friendship and experiences, think of that and that only. Do not dwell on my recent actions the last few days. This was a necessary evil that had to be executed in order for me to obtain my NAME back. The only thing that changes policy and garners attention is death.</p>\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-, greatest friend, Marine officer, aviator, and an even better father and husband. I Couldn&apos;t have had a better big brother than you. Your spoken wisdom was always retained by me, you old salty Mustang. You sternly told me that no matter what I accomplish I will always be a ni#%er in many individuals eyes. At the time, I did not comprehend your words. I do now. I never forgot the quote you state below. I love you bro.</p>\n\n<p>I never saw a wild thing feel sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever feeling sorry for itself. -D.H. Lawrence</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s kind of sad I won&apos;t be around to view and enjoy The Hangover III. What an awesome trilogy.<br>\n&#8212;&#8212;-, greatest friend, Naval officer, aviator, Great Father, husband, doctor, and even better human being. I always strived to live my life parallel to your similar values and personal disciplines. &#8212;&#8212;- is lucky to have found a man like yourself, and you are fortunate to have married an irrefutable imperfect woman. Always focus on your IMMEDIATE family as they are the ones who have loved you unconditionally and always been their to support you in difficult times. I always lived my life as WW&#8212;&#8212;-D (what would &#8212;&#8212;- do). &#8212;&#8212;-, take care of this guy. &#8212;&#8212;-, I&apos;m sorry I missed your wedding and you had to find another best man. I&apos;m sorry my predicament with the department stopped me from watching you and &#8212;&#8212;- get married and arguing with you about issues that were insignificant when I was really angry at the LAPD for what they did to me. I&apos;m deeply sorry and I love you guys.</p>\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-, great friend, attorney, father, husband, and the most cynical/blatant/politically incorrect friend a man can have. Best quality about you in college and now is that you never sugar coated the truth. I will miss our political discussions that always turned argumentative. Thanks for introducing me to outdoor sports like fishing, hunting, mudding, and also respect for the land and resources. Us city boys don&apos;t get out much like you Alaskans. You even introduced me to PBR. A beer, that when you&apos;re a poor college student is completely acceptable to get buzzed off of. I&apos;m sorry I&apos;ll never get to go on that moose and bear hunt with you. I love you bro.</p>\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-, greatest friend, accountant, entrepreneur, and even better Human being. You are probably the most well balanced person I&apos;ve ever met and the most driven for success. In college, and after graduation, I was inspired by your personal drive. Never settle. When you make your first million, promise me you won&apos;t forget to enjoy it a bit. I know your first reaction will be to invest it somewhere else. Spend a little, just a little. I love you bro.</p>\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-, great friend, entrepeneur, husband and father. You showed me the importance of fatherhood and friendship. Love you bro.</p>\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;-.</p>\n\n<p>You guys were all important and very special to me. Don&apos;t be angry with me. I missed some of your weddings and unfortunately, some of your funerals. This was a necessary evil.</p>\n\n<p>Gov. Chris Christie. What can I say? You&apos;re the only person I would like to see in the White House in 2016 other than Hillary.<br>\nSome say it is my fault that I was terminated. Yes, &#8212;&#8212;-, I remember you stating this to me in an angry fit. You said that I should have kept my mouth shut about another officer&apos;s misconduct. Maybe you were right. But I&apos;m not built like others, it&apos;s not in my DNA and my history has always shown that. When you view the video of the suspect stating he was kicked by &#8212;&#8212;-, maybe you will see that I was a decent person after all. I told the truth. It still hurt that you abandoned me in my time of need. I hope you&apos;re happy, that&apos;s all I ever wanted for you.</p>\n\n<p>Sgt. &#8212;&#8212;-, you meant well but you should have known with your time on the job that the department would attempt to protect someone like &#8212;&#8212;- because of her time on the job, personal friendships, and ethicity. I&apos;m not angry with you, but you should have known as an IA investigator.</p>\n\n<p>Sgt &#8212;&#8212;- LPPD, Ofcr &#8212;&#8212;- LPPD (ret), and Chief &#8212;&#8212;- LPPD, your guidance and mentoring as a young police explorer was second to none and invaluable as a young man, police officer, and naval officer. Sgt &#8212;&#8212;-, you forewarned me long ago about joining LAPD as they were &quot;different&quot; and operated differently from other modern law enforcement agencies. I now know it was your humbleness and respect for all who wear the badge and protect their communities that you didn&apos;t just express what you wanted to say, that they lack values and basic ethics as law enforcement officers. Chief &#8212;&#8212;-, your fucking awesome. Thanks for the long talks over the years when I was an explorer, college student, Naval officer, and Police officer. Your are a great leader and carry your heart on your sleeve. Your son will be a great Air Force officer with the upringing you provided. &#8212;&#8212;-, what can I say? Your just an awesome person and my first exposure to what law enforcement was really about was on our ride alongs. Your realistic approach and empathetic approach to treating all people as humans first is something I carried with me daily. Thank you, every one of you.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. &#8212;&#8212;-, thank you for the superb surgery you performed on my knee on 7/98 in Irvine, CA. I never had the opportunity to thank you for allowing me to live a life free of knee joint pain. Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>CM1 &#8212;&#8212;- (Ret.), I learned more from you about leadership than most of my own commanders. You lived by a strict ethos of get it done, and get it done right. I wanted to attend your retirement, I really did. But because of my predicament I was unable to. Hope you and Ritchie are still together. I&apos;ve always held you in high regard.</p>\n\n<p>Wayne LaPierre, President of the NRA, you&apos;re a vile and inhumane piece of shit.<br>\nSgt Maj. &#8212;&#8212;- USMC, Thank you for the intense instruction and mentorship and time spent forging me into a never quit officer. You were challenging as a DI. You made sure the vicious and intense personality I possess was discovered. On a lighter note....Don&apos;t feel humbled you never broke me. I made it a personal goal to never give up years before. The Corp is lucky to have you at the front. Your leadership is essential and needed for all marines, especially staff NCO&apos;s and mentorship and advisement to company grade officers. You are the epitome of a US marine and never forget that.</p>\n\n<p>I thank my friends for the awesome shared experiences. I thank the unnamed women I dated over my lifetime for the great and sometimes not so great sex.</p>\n\n<p>It&apos;s kind of sad I won&apos;t be around to view and enjoy The Hangover III. What an awesome trilogy. Todd Phillips, don&apos;t make anymore Hangovers after the third, takes away the originality of its foundation. World War Z looks good and The Walking Dead season 3 (second half) looked intriguing. Damn, gonna miss shark week.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Vice President, do your due diligence when formulating a concise and permanent national AWB plan. Future generations of Americans depend on your plan and advisement to the president. I&apos;ve always been a fan of yours and consider you one of the few genuine and charismatic politicians. Damn, sounds like an oxymoron calling you an honest politician. It&apos;s the truth.</p>\n\n<p>Hillary Clinton. You&apos;ll make one hell of a president in 2016. Much like your husband, Bill, you will be one of the greatest. Look at Castro in San Antonio as a running mate or possible secretary of state. He&apos;s (good people) and I have faith and confidence in him. Look after Bill. He was always my favorite President. Chelsea grew up to be one hell of an attractive woman. No disrespect to her husband.</p>\n\n<p>Gov. Chris Christie. What can I say? You&apos;re the only person I would like to see in the White House in 2016 other than Hillary. You&apos;re America&apos;s no shit taking uncle. Do one thing for your wife, kids, and supporters. Start walking at night and eat a little less, not a lot less, just a little. We want to see you around for a long time. Your leadership is greatly needed.</p>\n\n<p>Wayne LaPierre, President of the NRA, you&apos;re a vile and inhumane piece of shit. You never even showed 30 seconds of empathy for the children, teachers, and families of Sandy Hook. You deflected any type of blame/responsibility and directed it toward the influence of movies and the media. You are a failure of a human being. May all of your immediate and distant family die horrific deaths in front of you.</p>\n\n<p>Willie Geist, you&apos;re a talented and charismatic journalist.<br>\nChris Matthews, Joe Scarborough, Pat Harvey, Brian Williams, Soledad Obrien, Wolf Blitzer, Meredith Viera, Tavis Smiley, and Anderson Cooper, keep up the great work and follow Cronkite&apos;s lead. I hold many of you in the same regard as Tom Brokaw and the late Peter Jennings. Cooper, stop nagging and berating your guest, they&apos;re your (guest). Mr. Scarborough, we met at McGuire&apos;s pub in P-cola in 2002 when I was stationed there. It was an honor conversing with you about politics, family, and life.</p>\n\n<p>Willie Geist, you&apos;re a talented and charismatic journalist. Stop with all the talk show shenanigans and get back to your core of reporting. Your future is brighter than most.</p>\n\n<p>Revoke the citizenship of Fareed Zakaria and deport him. I&apos;ve never heard a positive word about America or its interest from his mouth, ever. On the same day, give Piers Morgan an indefinite resident alien and Visa card. Mr. Morgan, the problem that many American gun owners have with you and your continuous discussion of gun control is that you are not an American citizen and have an accent that is distinct and clarifies that you are a foreigner. I want you to know that I agree with you 100% on enacting stricter firearm laws but you must understand that your critics will always have in the back of their mind that you are native to a country that we won our sovereignty from while using firearms as a last resort in defense and you come from a country that has no legal private ownership of firearms. That is disheartening to American gun owners and rightfully so.</p>\n\n<p>The honorable President George H.W. Bush, they never give you enough credit for your successful Presidency. You were always one of my favorite Presidents (2nd favorite). I hope your health improves greatly. You are the epitome of an American and service to country.</p>\n\n<p>General Petraeus, you made a mistake that the majority of men make once, twice, or unfortunately many times in a lifetime. You are human. You thought with your penis. It&apos;s okay.I personally believe you should have never resigned and told your critics to shove it. You only answer to two people regarding the affair, your wife and children, period. I hope you return to government service to your country as it is visibly in your DNA.</p>\n\n<p>General Colin Powell, your book &quot;My American Journey&quot; solidified my decision to join the military after college. I had always intended to serve, but your book and journey motivated me. You are an inspiration to all Americans and influenced me greatly.</p>\n\n<p>To all SEA&apos;s (senior enlisted advisers), you are just as important if not a greater viability to large and small commands. It&apos;s time you take a more active role in leading your enlisted and advising officers. These are not your twilight years or time to relax. You can either strengthen the tip of the spear, or make it brittle. You decide.</p>\n\n<p>Pat Harvey, I&apos;ve always thought you carried yourself professionally and personally the way a strong black woman should. Your articulation and speech is second to none. You are the epitome of a journalist/anchor. You are America.</p>\n\n<p>Tebow, I really wanted to see you take charge of an offense again and the game.<br>\nEllen Degeneres, continue your excellent contribution to entertaining America and bringing the human factor to entertainment. You changed the perception of your gay community and how we as Americans view the LGBT community. I congratulate you on your success and opening my eyes as a young adult, and my generation to the fact that you are know different from us other than who you choose to love. Oh, and you Prop 8 supporters, why the fuck do you care who your neighbor marries. Hypocritical pieces of shit.</p>\n\n<p>Westboro Baptist Church, may you all burn slowly in a fire, not from smoke inhalation, but from the flames and only the flames.</p>\n\n<p>Tebow, I really wanted to see you take charge of an offense again and the game. You are not a good QB by todays standards, but you are a great football player who knows how to lead a team and WIN. You will be &quot;Tebowing&quot; when you reach your next team. I have faith in you. Get out of that circus they call the Jets and away from the reality TV star, Rex Ryan, and Mark Rapist Sanchez.</p>\n\n<p>Christopher Walz, you impressed me in Inglorious Basterds. After viewing Django Unchained, I was sold. I have come to the conclusion that you are well on your way to becoming one of the greats if not already and show glimpses of Daniel Day Lewis and Morgan Freeman-esque type qualities of greatness. Trust me when I say that you will be one of the greatest ever.</p>\n\n<p>Jennifer Beals, Serena Williams, Grae Drake, Lisa Nicole-Carson, Diana Taurasi, N&apos;bushe Wright, Brenda Villa, Kate Winslet, Ashley Graham, Erika Christensen, Gabrielle Union, Isabella Soprano, Zain Verjee, Tamron Hall, Gina Carano, America Ferrara, Giana Michaels, Nene, Natalie Portman, Queen Latifah, Michelle Rodriguez, Anjelah Johnson, Kelly Clarkson, Nora Jones, Laura Prepon, Margaret Cho, and Rutina Wesley, you are THE MOST beautiful women on this planet, period. Never settle, professionally or personally.</p>\n\n<p>Dave Brubeck&apos;s &quot;Take Five&quot; is the greatest piece of music ever, period. Hanz Zimmer, William Bell, Eric Clapton, BB King, Bob Marley, Sam Cooke, Metallica, Rob Zombie, Nora Jones, Marvin Gaye, Jay-Z, and the King (Louis Armstrong) are musical prodigies.</p>\n\n<p>Jeffrey Toobin and David Gergen, you are political geniuses and modern scholars. Hopefully Toobin is nominated for the Supreme Court and implements some damn common sense and reasoning instead of partisan bickering. But in true Toobin fashion, we all know he would not accept the nomination.</p>\n\n<p>Jeffrey Toobin and David Gergen, you are political geniuses and modern scholars.<br>\nJohn and Ken from KFI, never mute your facts and personal opinions. You are one of the few media personalities who speak the truth, even when the truth is not popular. I will miss listening to your discussions.</p>\n\n<p>Bill Handel, your effin awesome. For years I enjoyed your show.</p>\n\n<p>Anthony Bourdain, you&apos;re a modern renaissance man who epitomizes the saying &quot;too cool for school&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Larry David, Kevin Hart, the late Patrice Oneal, Lisa Lampanelli, Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Louis CK, Dave Chapelle, Jon Stewart, Wanda Sykes, Dennis Miller, and Jeff Ross are pure geniuses. I&apos;m a big fan of all of your work. As a child my mom caught me watching Def Jam comedy at midnight when I should have been asleep. Instead of scolding me, the next night she let me stay up late and watch George Carlin, Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor comedy specials with her for hours. My sides were sore for days.</p>\n\n<p>Larry David, I agree. 72-82 degrees is way to hot in a residence. 68 degrees is perfect.</p>\n\n<p>Cyclist, I have no problem sharing the road with you. But, at least go the fucking speed limit posted or get off the road!!! That is a feasible request. Livestrong you fraudulent assholes.</p>\n\n<p>Cardinal Mahoney, you are in essence a predator yourself as you enabled your subordinates to molest multiple children in the church over many decades. May you die a long and slow painful death.</p>\n\n<p>If you continuously followed me while I was walking at dusk/night I would confront you as well. Too bad Trayvon didn&apos;t smash your skull completely open, Zim. While Trayvon&apos;s body erodes to bones 6 feet under, Zimmerman has put on no less than 40 pounds while out on bail. Zimmerman was arrested for battery on a Peace officer and avoided jail/prison because he completed a diversion program. Thats a history of being an asshole. Zimmerman couldn&apos;t get hired by a LE agency because of poor credit/and a history of violence/restraining orders with women. So what does he do? Designate himself, neighborhood watch captain and make complaints to his city council about the horrible work ethic and laziness of the officers patrolling his neighborhood. Good one Zim. How classy that your father attempts to use his veterans status &quot;disabled veteran&quot; during your bail hearing but doesn&apos;t state what his disability percentage is. Prior service personnel know it can be 5% disability to 100%. You and your attorneys always avoid mentioning your fathers occupation as a magistrate/judge because I&apos;m sure he&apos;s utilized his position to get you out of way more jams then the public has discovered and that your family is not indigent. Oh, tell your wife to stop perjuring herself in court.</p>\n\n<p>KCCO</p>\n\n<p>Anonymous, you are hated, vilified, and considered an enemy to the state. I personally view you as a culture and a necessity that brings truth to a cloaked world. Forge ahead!</p>\n\n<p>Charlie Sheen, you&apos;re effin awesome.</p>\n\n<p>My opinion on women in combat MOS&apos;, Designators, Rates, and AFSC&apos;s. I wish all of you who attempt to pursue combat occupational roles the greatest success in completing, graduating, and qualifying in their respective schools/courses. Many want to see you fail. Remember, everyone of you is a pioneer. There was a time when they didn&apos;t allow blacks to fight the good fight. This is your civil rights. Don&apos;t quit!!!</p>\n\n<p>Charlie Sheen, you&apos;re effin awesome.<br>\nIt&apos;s time to allow gay service member&apos;s spouses to utilize the same benefits that all heterosexual dependents are eligible for. Medical, Dental, Tricare, Deers, SGLI, BX, Commissary, Milstar, MWR, etc. Flag officers, lets be honest. You can&apos;t really give a valid argument to as why gays shouldn&apos;t be eligible as every month a new state enacts laws that allow same sex marriage.</p>\n\n<p>LGBT community and supporters, the same way you have the right to voice your opinion on acceptance of gay marriage, Chick Fil-A has a right to voice their beliefs as well. That&apos;s what makes America so great. Freedom of expression. Don&apos;t be assholes and boycott/degrade their business and customers who patronize the locations. They make some damn good chicken! Vandalizing (graffiti) their locations does not help any cause.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Bill Cosby, you are a reasonable and talented man who has spoken the truth of the cultural anomalies within the black communities that need to change now. The black communities&apos; resentment toward you is because they don&apos;t like hearing the truth or having their clear and evident dirty laundry aired to the nation. The problem is, the country is not blind nor dumb. They believe we are animals. Do not mute your unvarnished truthful speech or moral compass. Blacks must strive for more in life than bling, hoes, and cars. The current culture is an epidemic that leaves them with no discernible future. They&apos;re suffocating and don&apos;t even know it. MLK Jr. Would be mortified at what he worked so hard for in our acceptance as equal beings and how unfortunately we stopped progressing and began digressing. Chicago&apos;s youth violence is a prime example of how our black communities values have declined. We can not address this nation&apos;s intolerant issues until we address our own communities morality issues first. Accountability. We need to hold ou<br>\n</p></blockquote><p></p>\n\n<p><strong>Related:</strong><br>\n<a href=\"http://laist.com/2013/02/07/ex-lapd_cop_christopher_dorner_beli.php\">Ex-LAPD Cop Christopher Dorner Believed to Be on Killing Rampage Targeting Law Enforcement</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://laist.com/2013/02/07/who_is_christopher_dorner.php\">Who Is Christopher Dorner?

The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have \ngreatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \u0093advanced\u0094 countries, but they have \ndestabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to \nwidespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted \nsevere damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It \nwill certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it \nwill probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased \nphysical suffering even in \u0093advanced\u0094 countries.<p>\n2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually \nachieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very \npainful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other \nliving organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system \nsurvives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as \nto prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.<p>\n3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the \nmore disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner \nrather than later.<p>\n4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make \nuse of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We \ncan\u0092t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the \nindustrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This \nis not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and \ntechnological basis of the present society.<p>\n5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the \nindustrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. \nThis does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have \nto confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have \nsomething new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness \nmovements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, \neven though we consider these to be highly important.<p>\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM<p>\n6. Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread \nmanifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can \nserve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.<p>\n7. But what is leftism? During the first half of the 20th century leftism could have been practically identified \nwith socialism. Today the movement is fragmented and it is not clear who can properly be called a leftist. \nWhen we speak of leftists in this article we have in mind mainly socialists, collectivists, \u0093politically correct\u0094 \ntypes, feminists, gay and disability activists, animal rights activists and the like. But not everyone who is \nassociated with one of these movements is a leftist. What we are trying to get at in discussing leftism is not \nso much movement or an ideology as a psychological type, or rather a collection of related types. Thus, \nwhat we mean by \u0093leftism\u0094 will emerge more clearly in the course of our discussion of leftist psychology. \n(Also, see paragraphs 227-230.)<p>\n8. Even so, our conception of leftism will remain a good deal less clear than we would wish, but there \ndoesn\u0092t seem to be any remedy for this. All we are trying to do here is indicate in a rough and approximate \nway the two psychological tendencies that we believe are the main driving force of modern leftism. We by \nno means claim to be telling the WHOLE truth about leftist psychology. Also, our discussion is meant to \napply to modern leftism only. We leave open the question of the extent to which our discussion could be \napplied to the leftists of the 19th and early 20th centuries.<p>\n9. The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call \u0093feelings of inferiority\u0094 and \n\u0093oversocialization.\u0094 Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while \noversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly \ninfluential.<p>\nFEELINGS OF INFERIORITY<p>\n10. By \u0093feelings of inferiority\u0094 we mean not only inferiority feelings in the strict sense but a whole spectrum \nof related traits; low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, depressive tendencies, defeatism, guilt, self-\nhatred, etc. We argue that modern leftists tend to have some such feelings (possibly more or less repressed) \nand that these feelings are decisive in determining the direction of modern leftism.<p>\n11. When someone interprets as derogatory almost anything that is said about him (or about groups with \nwhom he identifies) we conclude that he has inferiority feelings or low self-esteem. This tendency is \npronounced among minority rights activists, whether or not they belong to the minority groups whose rights \nthey defend. They are hypersensitive about the words used to designate minorities and about anything that is \nsaid concerning minorities. The terms \u0093negro,\u0094 \u0093oriental,\u0094 \u0093handicapped\u0094 or \u0093chick\u0094 for an African, an \nAsian, a disabled person or a woman originally had no derogatory connotation. \u0093Broad\u0094 and \u0093chick\u0094 were \nmerely the feminine equivalents of \u0093guy,\u0094 \u0093dude\u0094 or \u0093fellow.\u0094 The negative connotations have been \nattached to these terms by the activists themselves. Some animal rights activists have gone so far as to reject \nthe word \u0093pet\u0094 and insist on its replacement by \u0093animal companion.\u0094 Leftish anthropologists go to great \nlengths to avoid saying anything about primitive peoples that could conceivably be interpreted as negative. \nThey want to replace the world \u0093primitive\u0094 by \u0093nonliterate.\u0094 They seem almost paranoid about anything that \nmight suggest that any primitive culture is inferior to our own. (We do not mean to imply that primitive \ncultures ARE inferior to ours. We merely point out the hypersensitivity of leftish anthropologists.)<p>\n12. Those who are most sensitive about \u0093politically incorrect\u0094 terminology are not the average black ghetto-\ndweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do \nnot even belong to any \u0093oppressed\u0094 group but come from privileged strata of society. Political correctness \nhas its stronghold among university professors, who have secure employment with comfortable salaries, and \nthe majority of whom are heterosexual white males from middle- to upper-middle-class families.<p>\n13. Many leftists have an intense identification with the problems of groups that have an image of being \nweak (women), defeated (American Indians), repellent (homosexuals) or otherwise inferior. The leftists \nthemselves feel that these groups are inferior. They would never admit to themselves that they have such \nfeelings, but it is precisely because they do see these groups as inferior that they identify with their \nproblems. (We do not mean to suggest that women, Indians, etc. ARE inferior; we are only making a point \nabout leftist psychology.)<p>\n14. Feminists are desperately anxious to prove that women are as strong and as capable as men. Clearly they \nare nagged by a fear that women may NOT be as strong and as capable as men.<p>\n15. Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate \nAmerica, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that \nleftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate \nthe West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults \nappear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he \nGRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly \nexaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not \nthe leftist\u0092s real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are \nstrong and successful.<p>\n16. Words like \u0093self-confidence,\u0094 \u0093self-reliance,\u0094 \u0093initiative,\u0094 \u0093enterprise,\u0094 \u0093optimism,\u0094 etc., play little role \nin the liberal and leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to \nsolve everyone\u0092s problems for them, satisfy everyone\u0092s needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort \nof person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own \nneeds. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a \nloser.<p>\n17. Art forms that appeal to modern leftish intellectuals tend to focus on sordidness, defeat and despair, or \nelse they take an orgiastic tone, throwing off rational control as if there were no hope of accomplishing \nanything through rational calculation and all that was left was to immerse oneself in the sensations of the \nmoment.<p>\n18. Modern leftish philosophers tend to dismiss reason, science, objective reality and to insist that \neverything is culturally relative. It is true that one can ask serious questions about the foundations of \nscientific knowledge and about how, if at all, the concept of objective reality can be defined. But it is \nobvious that modern leftish philosophers are not simply cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the \nfoundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality. They \nattack these concepts because of their own psychological needs. For one thing, their attack is an outlet for \nhostility, and, to the extent that it is successful, it satisfies the drive for power. More importantly, the leftist \nhates science and rationality because they classify certain beliefs as true (i.e., successful, superior) and other \nbeliefs as false (i.e., failed, inferior). The leftist\u0092s feelings of inferiority run so deep that he cannot tolerate \nany classification of some things as successful or superior and other things as failed or inferior. This also \nunderlies the rejection by many leftists of the concept of mental illness and of the utility of IQ tests. Leftists \nare antagonistic to genetic explanations of human abilities or behavior because such explanations tend to \nmake some persons appear superior or inferior to others. Leftists prefer to give society the credit or blame \nfor an individual\u0092s ability or lack of it. Thus if a person is \u0093inferior\u0094 it is not his fault, but society\u0092s, because \nhe has not been brought up properly.<p>\n19. The leftist is not typically the kind of person whose feelings of inferiority make him a braggart, an \negotist, a bully, a self-promoter, a ruthless competitor. This kind of person has not wholly lost faith in \nhimself. He has a deficit in his sense of power and self-worth, but he can still conceive of himself as having \nthe capacity to be strong, and his efforts to make himself strong produce his unpleasant behavior. [1] But \nthe leftist is too far gone for that. His feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of \nhimself as individually strong and valuable. Hence the collectivism of the leftist. He can feel strong only as \na member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies himself.<p>\n20. Notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics. Leftists protest by lying down in front of vehicles, they \nintentionally provoke police or racists to abuse them, etc. These tactics may often be effective, but many \nleftists use them not as a means to an end but because they PREFER masochistic tactics. Self-hatred is a \nleftist trait.<p>\n21. Leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principles, and moral \nprinciple does play a role for the leftist of the oversocialized type. But compassion and moral principle \ncannot be the main motives for leftist activism. Hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior; \nso is the drive for power. Moreover, much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the \npeople whom the leftists claim to be trying to help. For example, if one believes that affirmative action is \ngood for black people, does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms? \nObviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at \nleast verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates \nagainst them. But leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional \nneeds. Helping black people is not their real goal. Instead, race problems serve as an excuse for them to \nexpress their own hostility and frustrated need for power. In doing so they actually harm black people, \nbecause the activists\u0092 hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred.<p>\n22. If our society had no social problems at all, the leftists would have to INVENT problems in order to \nprovide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss.<p>\n23. We emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might \nbe considered a leftist. It is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism.<p>\nOVERSOCIALIZATION<p>\n24. Psychologists use the term \u0093socialization\u0094 to designate the process by which children are trained to \nthink and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the \nmoral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say \nthat many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can \nbe defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.<p>\n25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral \nway. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time \nor other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to \nthink, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they \ncontinually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings \nand actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term \u0093oversocialized\u0094 to describe such \npeople. [2]<p>\n26. Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the \nmost important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior \nor speech that is contrary to society\u0092s expectations. If this is overdone, or if a particular child is especially \nsusceptible to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF. Moreover the thought and the \nbehavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by society\u0092s expectations than are those of the \nlightly socialized person. The majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior. They \nlie, they commit petty thefts, they break traffic laws, they goof off at work, they hate someone, they say \nspiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy. The oversocialized person \ncannot do these things, or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self-hatred. The \noversocialized person cannot even experience, without guilt, thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the \naccepted morality; he cannot think \u0093unclean\u0094 thoughts. And socialization is not just a matter of morality; we \nare socialized to conform to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality. Thus \nthe oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society \nhas laid down for him. In many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness \nthat can be a severe hardship. We suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that \nhuman beings inflict on one another.<p>\n27. We argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that \ntheir oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism. Leftists of the \noversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper-middle class. Notice that university \nintellectuals [3] constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left-wing \nsegment.<p>\n28. The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by \nrebelling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally \nspeaking, the goals of today\u0092s leftists are NOT in conflict with the accepted morality. On the contrary, the \nleft takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating \nthat principle. Examples: racial equality, equality of the sexes, helping poor people, peace as opposed to \nwar, nonviolence generally, freedom of expression, kindness to animals. More fundamentally, the duty of \nthe individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. All these have been \ndeeply rooted values of our society (or at least of its middle and upper classes [4] for a long time. These \nvalues are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the \nmainstream communications media and the educational system. Leftists, especially those of the \noversocialized type, usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by \nclaiming (with some degree of truth) that society is not living up to these principles.<p>\n29. Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the \nconventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion against it. Many leftists push for \naffirmative action, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools \nand more money for such schools; the way of life of the black \u0093underclass\u0094 they regard as a social disgrace. \nThey want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist \njust like upper-middle-class white people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the \nblack man into a copy of the white man; instead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in \nwhat does this preservation of African American culture consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than \neating black-style food, listening to black-style music, wearing black-style clothing and going to a black-\nstyle church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL \nrespects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white, middle-class \nideals. They want to make him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life \nclimbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers \n\u0093responsible,\u0094 they want black gangs to become nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the \nindustrial-technological system. The system couldn\u0092t care less what kind of music a man listens to, what \nkind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable \njob, climbs the status ladder, is a \u0093responsible\u0094 parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much \nhe may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him \nadopt its values.<p>\n30. We certainly do not claim that leftists, even of the oversocialized type, NEVER rebel against the \nfundamental values of our society. Clearly they sometimes do. Some oversocialized leftists have gone so far \nas to rebel against one of modern society\u0092s most important principles by engaging in physical violence. By \ntheir own account, violence is for them a form of \u0093liberation.\u0094 In other words, by committing violence they \nbreak through the psychological restraints that have been trained into them. Because they are oversocialized \nthese restraints have been more confining for them than for others; hence their need to break free of them. \nBut they usually justify their rebellion in terms of mainstream values. If they engage in violence they claim \nto be fighting against racism or the like.<p>\n31. We realize that many objections could be raised to the foregoing thumbnail sketch of leftist psychology. \nThe real situation is complex, and anything like a complete description of it would take several volumes \neven if the necessary data were available. We claim only to have indicated very roughly the two most \nimportant tendencies in the psychology of modern leftism.<p>\n32. The problems of the leftist are indicative of the problems of our society as a whole. Low self-esteem, \ndepressive tendencies and defeatism are not restricted to the left. Though they are especially noticeable in \nthe left, they are widespread in our society. And today\u0092s society tries to socialize us to a greater extent than \nany previous society. We are even told by experts how to eat, how to exercise, how to make love, how to \nraise our kids and so forth.<p>\nTHE POWER PROCESS<p>\n33. Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call the \u0093power \nprocess.\u0094 This is closely related to the need for power (which is widely recognized) but is not quite the same \nthing. The power process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, effort and \nattainment of goal. (Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in \nattaining at least some of his goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary \nfor everyone. We call it autonomy and will discuss it later (paragraphs 42-44).<p>\n34. Consider the hypothetical case of a man who can have anything he wants just by wishing for it. Such a \nman has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by \nand by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he may become clinically depressed. \nHistory shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies \nthat have to struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert \nthemselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. This shows \nthat power is not enough. One must have goals toward which to exercise one\u0092s power.<p>\n35. Everyone has goals; if nothing else, to obtain the physical necessities of life: food, water and whatever \nclothing and shelter are made necessary by the climate. But the leisured aristocrat obtains these things \nwithout effort. Hence his boredom and demoralization.<p>\n36. Nonattainment of important goals results in death if the goals are physical necessities, and in frustration \nif nonattainment of the goals is compatible with survival. Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life \nresults in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression.<p>\n37, Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment \nrequires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals.<p>\nSURROGATE ACTIVITIES<p>\n38. But not every leisured aristocrat becomes bored and demoralized. For example, the emperor Hirohito, \ninstead of sinking into decadent hedonism, devoted himself to marine biology, a field in which he became \ndistinguished. When people do not have to exert themselves to satisfy their physical needs they often set up \nartificial goals for themselves. In many cases they then pursue these goals with the same energy and \nemotional involvement that they otherwise would have put into the search for physical necessities. Thus the \naristocrats of the Roman Empire had their literary pretensions; many European aristocrats a few centuries \nago invested tremendous time and energy in hunting, though they certainly didn\u0092t need the meat; other \naristocracies have competed for status through elaborate displays of wealth; and a few aristocrats, like \nHirohito, have turned to science.<p>\n39. We use the term \u0093surrogate activity\u0094 to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that \npeople set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the \nsake of the \u0093fulfillment\u0094 that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification \nof surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask \nyourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that \neffort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel \nseriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person\u0092s pursuit of goal X \nis a surrogate activity. Hirohito\u0092s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is \npretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order \nto obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn\u0092t know all about the \nanatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is \nnot a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel \ndeprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. \n(But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)<p>\n40. In modern industrial society only minimal effort is necessary to satisfy one\u0092s physical needs. It is \nenough to go through a training program to acquire some petty technical skill, then come to work on time \nand exert the very modest effort needed to hold a job. The only requirements are a moderate amount of \nintelligence and, most of all, simple OBEDIENCE. If one has those, society takes care of one from cradle to \ngrave. (Yes, there is an underclass that cannot take the physical necessities for granted, but we are speaking \nhere of mainstream society.) Thus it is not surprising that modern society is full of surrogate activities. \nThese include scientific work, athletic achievement, humanitarian work, artistic and literary creation, \nclimbing the corporate ladder, acquisition of money and material goods far beyond the point at which they \ncease to give any additional physical satisfaction, and social activism when it addresses issues that are not \nimportant for the activist personally, as in the case of white activists who work for the rights of nonwhite \nminorities. These are not always PURE surrogate activities, since for many people they may be motivated in \npart by needs other than the need to have some goal to pursue. Scientific work may be motivated in part by \na drive for prestige, artistic creation by a need to express feelings, militant social activism by hostility. But \nfor most people who pursue them, these activities are in large part surrogate activities. For example, the \nmajority of scientists will probably agree that the \u0093fulfillment\u0094 they get from their work is more important \nthan the money and prestige they earn.<p>\n41. For many if not most people, surrogate activities are less satisfying than the pursuit of real goals (that is, \ngoals that people would want to attain even if their need for the power process were already fulfilled). One \nindication of this is the fact that, in many or most cases, people who are deeply involved in surrogate \nactivities are never satisfied, never at rest. Thus the money-maker constantly strives for more and more \nwealth. The scientist no sooner solves one problem than he moves on to the next. The long-distance runner \ndrives himself to run always farther and faster. Many people who pursue surrogate activities will say that \nthey get far more fulfillment from these activities than they do from the \u0093mundane\u0094 business of satisfying \ntheir biological needs, but that is because in our society the effort needed to satisfy the biological needs has \nbeen reduced to triviality. More importantly, in our society people do not satisfy their biological needs \nAUTONOMOUSLY but by functioning as parts of an immense social machine. In contrast, people \ngenerally have a great deal of autonomy in pursuing their surrogate activities.<p>\nAUTONOMY<p>\n42. Autonomy as a part of the power process may not be necessary for every individual. But most people \nneed a greater or lesser degree of autonomy in working toward their goals. Their efforts must be undertaken \non their own initiative and must be under their own direction and control. Yet most people do not have to \nexert this initiative, direction and control as single individuals. It is usually enough to act as a member of a \nSMALL group. Thus if half a dozen people discuss a goal among themselves and make a successful joint \neffort to attain that goal, their need for the power process will be served. But if they work under rigid orders \nhanded down from above that leave them no room for autonomous decision and initiative, then their need \nfor the power process will not be served. The same is true when decisions are made on a collective basis if \nthe group making the collective decision is so large that the role of each individual is insignificant. [5]<p>\n43. It is true that some individuals seem to have little need for autonomy. Either their drive for power is \nweak or they satisfy it by identifying themselves with some powerful organization to which they belong. \nAnd then there are unthinking, animal types who seem to be satisfied with a purely physical sense of power \n(the good combat soldier, who gets his sense of power by developing fighting skills that he is quite content \nto use in blind obedience to his superiors).<p>\n44. But for most people it is through the power process\u0097having a goal, making an AUTONOMOUS effort \nand attaining the goal\u0097that self-esteem, self-confidence and a sense of power are acquired. When one does \nnot have adequate opportunity to go through the power process the consequences are (depending on the \nindividual and on the way the power process is disrupted) boredom, demoralization, low self-esteem, \ninferiority feelings, defeatism, depression, anxiety, guilt, frustration, hostility, spouse or child abuse, \ninsatiable hedonism, abnormal sexual behavior, sleep disorders, eating disorders, etc. [6]<p>\nSOURCES OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS<p>\n45. Any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in any society, but in modern industrial society they are \npresent on a massive scale. We aren\u0092t the first to mention that the world today seems to be going crazy. This \nsort of thing is not normal for human societies. There is good reason to believe that primitive man suffered \nfrom less stress and frustration and was better satisfied with his way of life than modern man is. It is true \nthat not all was sweetness and light in primitive societies. Abuse of women was common among the \nAustralian aborigines, transexuality was fairly common among some of the American Indian tribes. But it \ndoes appear that GENERALLY SPEAKING the kinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding \nparagraph were far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society.<p>\n46. We attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society \nrequires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved \nand to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living \nunder the earlier conditions. It is clear from what we have already written that we consider lack of \nopportunity to properly experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal conditions to \nwhich modern society subjects people. But it is not the only one. Before dealing with disruption of the \npower process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the other sources.<p>\n47. Among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density of \npopulation, isolation of man from nature, excessive rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural \nsmall-scale communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe.<p>\n48. It is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression. The degree of crowding that exists today \nand the isolation of man from nature are consequences of technological progress. All pre-industrial societies \nwere predominantly rural. The Industrial Revolution vastly increased the size of cities and the proportion of \nthe population that lives in them, and modern agricultural technology has made it possible for the Earth to \nsupport a far denser population than it ever did before. (Also, technology exacerbates the effects of \ncrowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people\u0092s hands. For example, a variety of noise-\nmaking devices: power mowers, radios, motorcycles, etc. If the use of these devices is unrestricted, people \nwho want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise. If their use is restricted, people who use the devices \nare frustrated by the regulations. But if these machines had never been invented there would have been no \nconflict and no frustration generated by them.)<p>\n49. For primitive societies the natural world (which usually changes only slowly) provided a stable \nframework and therefore a sense of security. In the modern world it is human society that dominates nature \nrather than the other way around, and modern society changes very rapidly owing to technological change. \nThus there is no stable framework.<p>\n50. The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically \nsupport technological progress and economic growth. Apparently it never occurs to them that you can\u0092t \nmake rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes \nin all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional \nvalues.<p>\n51. The breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown of the bonds that hold \ntogether traditional small-scale social groups. The disintegration of small-scale social groups is also \npromoted by the fact that modern conditions often require or tempt individuals to move to new locations, \nseparating themselves from their communities. Beyond that, a technological society HAS TO weaken family \nties and local communities if it is to function efficiently. In modern society an individual\u0092s loyalty must be \nfirst to the system and only secondarily to a small-scale community, because if the internal loyalties of \nsmall-scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system, such communities would pursue their \nown advantage at the expense of the system.<p>\n52. Suppose that a public official or a corporation executive appoints his cousin, his friend or his co-\nreligionist to a position rather than appointing the person best qualified for the job. He has permitted \npersonal loyalty to supersede his loyalty to the system, and that is \u0093nepotism\u0094 or \u0093discrimination,\u0094 both of \nwhich are terrible sins in modern society. Would-be industrial societies that have done a poor job of \nsubordinating personal or local loyalties to loyalty to the system are usually very inefficient. (Look at Latin \nAmerica.) Thus an advanced industrial society can tolerate only those small-scale communities that are \nemasculated, tamed and made into tools of the system. [7]<p>\n53. Crowding, rapid change and the breakdown of communities have been widely recognized as sources of \nsocial problems. But we do not believe they are enough to account for the extent of the problems that are \nseen today.<p>\n54. A few pre-industrial cities were very large and crowded, yet their inhabitants do not seem to have \nsuffered from psychological problems to the same extent as modern man. In America today there still are \nuncrowded rural areas, and we find there the same problems as in urban areas, though the problems tend to \nbe less acute in the rural areas. Thus crowding does not seem to be the decisive factor.<p>\n55. On the growing edge of the American frontier during the 19th century, the mobility of the population \nprobably broke down extended families and small-scale social groups to at least the same extent as these are \nbroken down today. In fact, many nuclear families lived by choice in such isolation, having no neighbors \nwithin several miles, that they belonged to no community at all, yet they do not seem to have developed \nproblems as a result.<p>\n56. Furthermore, change in American frontier society was very rapid and deep. A man might be born and \nraised in a log cabin, outside the reach of law and order and fed largely on wild meat; and by the time he \narrived at old age he might be working at a regular job and living in an ordered community with effective \nlaw enforcement. This was a deeper change than that which typically occurs in the life of a modern \nindividual, yet it does not seem to have led to psychological problems. In fact, 19th century American \nsociety had an optimistic and self-confident tone, quite unlike that of today\u0092s society. [8]<p>\n57. The difference, we argue, is that modern man has the sense (largely justified) that change is IMPOSED \non him, whereas the 19th century frontiersman had the sense (also largely justified) that he created change \nhimself, by his own choice. Thus a pioneer settled on a piece of land of his own choosing and made it into a \nfarm through his own effort. In those days an entire county might have only a couple of hundred inhabitants \nand was a far more isolated and autonomous entity than a modern county is. Hence the pioneer farmer \nparticipated as a member of a relatively small group in the creation of a new, ordered community. One may \nwell question whether the creation of this community was an improvement, but at any rate it satisfied the \npioneer\u0092s need for the power process.<p>\n58. It would be possible to give other examples of societies in which there has been rapid change and/or \nlack of close community ties without the kind of massive behavioral aberration that is seen in today\u0092s \nindustrial society. We contend that the most important cause of social and psychological problems in \nmodern society is the fact that people have insufficient opportunity to go through the power process in a \nnormal way. We don\u0092t mean to say that modern society is the only one in which the power process has been \ndisrupted. Probably most if not all civilized societies have interfered with the power process to a greater or \nlesser extent. But in modern industrial society the problem has become particularly acute. Leftism, at least \nin its recent (mid- to late-20th century) form, is in part a symptom of deprivation with respect to the power \nprocess.<p>\nDISRUPTION OF THE POWER PROCESS IN MODERN SOCIETY<p>\n59. We divide human drives into three groups: (1) those drives that can be satisfied with minimal effort; (2) \nthose that can be satisfied but only at the cost of serious effort; (3) those that cannot be adequately satisfied \nno matter how much effort one makes. The power process is the process of satisfying the drives of the \nsecond group. The more drives there are in the third group, the more there is frustration, anger, eventually \ndefeatism, depression, etc.<p>\n60. In modern industrial society natural human drives tend to be pushed into the first and third groups, and \nthe second group tends to consist increasingly of artificially created drives.<p>\n61. In primitive societies, physical necessities generally fall into group 2: They can be obtained, but only at \nthe cost of serious effort. But modern society tends to guaranty the physical necessities to everyone [9] in \nexchange for only minimal effort, hence physical needs are pushed into group 1. (There may be \ndisagreement about whether the effort needed to hold a job is \u0093minimal\u0094; but usually, in lower- to middle-\nlevel jobs, whatever effort is required is merely that of OBEDIENCE. You sit or stand where you are told to \nsit or stand and do what you are told to do in the way you are told to do it. Seldom do you have to exert \nyourself seriously, and in any case you have hardly any autonomy in work, so that the need for the power \nprocess is not well served.)<p>\n62. Social needs, such as sex, love and status, often remain in group 2 in modern society, depending on the \nsituation of the individual. [10] But, except for people who have a particularly strong drive for status, the \neffort required to fulfill the social drives is insufficient to satisfy adequately the need for the power \nprocess.<p>\n63. So certain artificial needs have been created that fall into group 2, hence serve the need for the power \nprocess. Advertising and marketing techniques have been developed that make many people feel they need \nthings that their grandparents never desired or even dreamed of. It requires serious effort to earn enough \nmoney to satisfy these artificial needs, hence they fall into group 2. (But see paragraphs 80-82.) Modern \nman must satisfy his need for the power process largely through pursuit of the artificial needs created by the \nadvertising and marketing industry [11], and through surrogate activities.<p>\n64. It seems that for many people, maybe the majority, these artificial forms of the power process are \ninsufficient. A theme that appears repeatedly in the writings of the social critics of the second half of the \n20th century is the sense of purposelessness that afflicts many people in modern society. (This \npurposelessness is often called by other names such as \u0093anomic\u0094 or \u0093middle-class vacuity.\u0094) We suggest \nthat the so-called \u0093identity crisis\u0094 is actually a search for a sense of purpose, often for commitment to a \nsuitable surrogate activity. It may be that existentialism is in large part a response to the purposelessness of \nmodern life. [12] Very widespread in modern society is the search for \u0093fulfillment.\u0094 But we think that for \nthe majority of people an activity whose main goal is fulfillment (that is, a surrogate activity) does not bring \ncompletely satisfactory fulfillment. In other words, it does not fully satisfy the need for the power process. \n(See paragraph 41.) That need can be fully satisfied only through activities that have some external goal, \nsuch as physical necessities, sex, love, status, revenge, etc.<p>\n65. Moreover, where goals are pursued through earning money, climbing the status ladder or functioning as \npart of the system in some other way, most people are not in a position to pursue their goals \nAUTONOMOUSLY. Most workers are someone else\u0092s employee and, as we pointed out in paragraph 61, \nmust spend their days doing what they are told to do in the way they are told to do it. Even people who are \nin business for themselves have only limited autonomy. It is a chronic complaint of small-business persons \nand entrepreneurs that their hands are tied by excessive government regulation. Some of these regulations \nare doubtless unnecessary, but for the most part government regulations are essential and inevitable parts of \nour extremely complex society. A large portion of small business today operates on the franchise system. It \nwas reported in the Wall Street Journal a few years ago that many of the franchise-granting companies \nrequire applicants for franchises to take a personality test that is designed to EXCLUDE those who have \ncreativity and initiative, because such persons are not sufficiently docile to go along obediently with the \nfranchise system. This excludes from small business many of the people who most need autonomy.<p>\n66. Today people live more by virtue of what the system does FOR them or TO them than by virtue of what \nthey do for themselves. And what they do for themselves is done more and more along channels laid down \nby the system. Opportunities tend to be those that the system provides, the opportunities must be exploited \nin accord with rules and regulations [13], and techniques prescribed by experts must be followed if there is \nto be a chance of success.<p>\n67. Thus the power process is disrupted in our society through a deficiency of real goals and a deficiency of \nautonomy in the pursuit of goals. But it is also disrupted because of those human drives that fall into group \n3: the drives that one cannot adequately satisfy no matter how much effort one makes. One of these drives is \nthe need for security. Our lives depend on decisions made by other people; we have no control over these \ndecisions and usually we do not even know the people who make them. (\u0093We live in a world in which \nrelatively few people\u0097maybe 500 or 1,000\u0097make the important decisions\u0094\u0097Philip B. Heymann of \nHarvard Law School, quoted by Anthony Lewis, New York Times, April 21, 1995.) Our lives depend on \nwhether safety standards at a nuclear power plant are properly maintained; on how much pesticide is \nallowed to get into our food or how much pollution into our air; on how skillful (or incompetent) our doctor \nis; whether we lose or get a job may depend on decisions made by government economists or corporation \nexecutives; and so forth. Most individuals are not in a position to secure themselves against these threats to \nmore [than] a very limited extent. The individual\u0092s search for security is therefore frustrated, which leads to \na sense of powerlessness.<p>\n68. It may be objected that primitive man is physically less secure than modern man, as is shown by his \nshorter life expectancy; hence modern man suffers from less, not more than the amount of insecurity that is \nnormal for human beings. But psychological security does not closely correspond with physical security. \nWhat makes us FEEL secure is not so much objective security as a sense of confidence in our ability to take \ncare of ourselves. Primitive man, threatened by a fierce animal or by hunger, can fight in self-defense or \ntravel in search of food. He has no certainty of success in these efforts, but he is by no means helpless \nagainst the things that threaten him. The modern individual on the other hand is threatened by many things \nagainst which he is helpless: nuclear accidents, carcinogens in food, environmental pollution, war, \nincreasing taxes, invasion of his privacy by large organizations, nationwide social or economic phenomena \nthat may disrupt his way of life.<p>\n69. It is true that primitive man is powerless against some of the things that threaten him; disease for \nexample. But he can accept the risk of disease stoically. It is part of the nature of things, it is no one\u0092s fault, \nunless it is the fault of some imaginary, impersonal demon. But threats to the modern individual tend to be \nMAN-MADE. They are not the results of chance but are IMPOSED on him by other persons whose \ndecisions he, as an individual, is unable to influence. Consequently he feels frustrated, humiliated and \nangry.<p>\n70. Thus primitive man for the most part has his security in his own hands (either as an individual or as a \nmember of a SMALL group) whereas the security of modern man is in the hands of persons or \norganizations that are too remote or too large for him to be able personally to influence them. So modern \nman\u0092s drive for security tends to fall into groups 1 and 3; in some areas (food, shelter etc.) his security is \nassured at the cost of only trivial effort, whereas in other areas he CANNOT attain security. (The foregoing \ngreatly simplifies the real situation, but it does indicate in a rough, general way how the condition of \nmodern man differs from that of primitive man.)<p>\n71. People have many transitory drives or impulses that are necessarily frustrated in modern life, hence fall \ninto group 3. One may become angry, but modern society cannot permit fighting. In many situations it does \nnot even permit verbal aggression. When going somewhere one may be in a hurry, or one may be in a mood \nto travel slowly, but one generally has no choice but to move with the flow of traffic and obey the traffic \nsignals. One may want to do one\u0092s work in a different way, but usually one can work only according to the \nrules laid down by one\u0092s employer. In many other ways as well, modern man is strapped down by a network \nof rules and regulations (explicit or implicit) that frustrate many of his impulses and thus interfere with the \npower process. Most of these regulations cannot be dispensed with, because they are necessary for the \nfunctioning of industrial society.<p>\n72. Modern society is in certain respects extremely permissive. In matters that are irrelevant to the \nfunctioning of the system we can generally do what we please. We can believe in any religion we like (as \nlong as it does not encourage behavior that is dangerous to the system). We can go to bed with anyone we \nlike (as long as we practice \u0093safe sex\u0094). We can do anything we like as long as it is UNIMPORTANT. But \nin all IMPORTANT matters the system tends increasingly to regulate our behavior.<p>\n73. Behavior is regulated not only through explicit rules and not only by the government. Control is often \nexercised through indirect coercion or through psychological pressure or manipulation, and by \norganizations other than the government, or by the system as a whole. Most large organizations use some \nform of propaganda [14] to manipulate public attitudes or behavior. Propaganda is not limited to \n\u0093commercials\u0094 and advertisements, and sometimes it is not even consciously intended as propaganda by the \npeople who make it. For instance, the content of entertainment programming is a powerful form of \npropaganda. An example of indirect coercion: There is no law that says we have to go to work every day \nand follow our employer\u0092s orders. Legally there is nothing to prevent us from going to live in the wild like \nprimitive people or from going into business for ourselves. But in practice there is very little wild country \nleft, and there is room in the economy for only a limited number of small business owners. Hence most of us \ncan survive only as someone else\u0092s employee.<p>\n74. We suggest that modern man\u0092s obsession with longevity, and with maintaining physical vigor and sexual \nattractiveness to an advanced age, is a symptom of unfulfillment resulting from deprivation with respect to \nthe power process. The \u0093mid-life crisis\u0094 also is such a symptom. So is the lack of interest in having children \nthat is fairly common in modern society but almost unheard-of in primitive societies.<p>\n75. In primitive societies life is a succession of stages. The needs and purposes of one stage having been \nfulfilled, there is no particular reluctance about passing on to the next stage. A young man goes through the \npower process by becoming a hunter, hunting not for sport or for fulfillment but to get meat that is \nnecessary for food. (In young women the process is more complex, with greater emphasis on social power; \nwe won\u0092t discuss that here.) This phase having been successfully passed through, the young man has no \nreluctance about settling down to the responsibilities of raising a family. (In contrast, some modern people \nindefinitely postpone having children because they are too busy seeking some kind of \u0093fulfillment.\u0094 We \nsuggest that the fulfillment they need is adequate experience of the power process\u0097with real goals instead \nof the artificial goals of surrogate activities.) Again, having successfully raised his children, going through \nthe power process by providing them with the physical necessities, the primitive man feels that his work is \ndone and he is prepared to accept old age (if he survives that long) and death. Many modern people, on the \nother hand, are disturbed by the prospect of physical deterioration and death, as is shown by the amount of \neffort they expend trying to maintain their physical condition, appearance and health. We argue that this is \ndue to unfulfillment resulting from the fact that they have never put their physical powers to any practical \nuse, have never gone through the power process using their bodies in a serious way. It is not the primitive \nman, who has used his body daily for practical purposes, who fears the deterioration of age, but the modern \nman, who has never had a practical use for his body beyond walking from his car to his house. It is the man \nwhose need for the power process has been satisfied during his life who is best prepared to accept the end of \nthat life.<p>\n76. In response to the arguments of this section someone will say, \u0093Society must find a way to give people \nthe opportunity to go through the power process.\u0094 For such people the value of the opportunity is destroyed \nby the very fact that society gives it to them. What they need is to find or make their own opportunities. As \nlong as the system GIVES them their opportunities it still has them on a leash. To attain autonomy they \nmust get off that leash.<p>\nHOW SOME PEOPLE ADJUST<p>\n 77. Not everyone in industrial-technological society suffers from psychological problems. Some people \neven profess to be quite satisfied with society as it is. We now discuss some of the reasons why people \ndiffer so greatly in their response to modern society.<p>\n78. First, there doubtless are differences in the strength of the drive for power. Individuals with a weak \ndrive for power may have relatively little need to go through the power process, or at least relatively little \nneed for autonomy in the power process. These are docile types who would have been happy as plantation \ndarkies in the Old South. (We don\u0092t mean to sneer at the \u0093plantation darkies\u0094 of the Old South. To their \ncredit, most of the slaves were NOT content with their servitude. We do sneer at people who ARE content \nwith servitude.)<p>\n79. Some people may have some exceptional drive, in pursuing which they satisfy their need for the power \nprocess. For example, those who have an unusually strong drive for social status may spend their whole \nlives climbing the status ladder without ever getting bored with that game.<p>\n80. People vary in their susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques. Some are so susceptible that, \neven if they make a great deal of money, they cannot satisfy their constant craving for the the shiny new \ntoys that the marketing industry dangles before their eyes. So they always feel hard-pressed financially even \nif their income is large, and their cravings are frustrated.<p>\n81. Some people have low susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques. These are the people who \naren\u0092t interested in money. Material acquisition does not serve their need for the power process.<p>\n82. People who have medium susceptibility to advertising and marketing techniques are able to earn enough \nmoney to satisfy their craving for goods and services, but only at the cost of serious effort (putting in \novertime, taking a second job, earning promotions, etc.). Thus material acquisition serves their need for the \npower process. But it does not necessarily follow that their need is fully satisfied. They may have \ninsufficient autonomy in the power process (their work may consist of following orders) and some of their \ndrives may be frustrated (e.g., security, aggression). (We are guilty of oversimplification in paragraphs 80-\n82 because we have assumed that the desire for material acquisition is entirely a creation of the advertising \nand marketing industry. Of course it\u0092s not that simple. [11]<p>\n83. Some people partly satisfy their need for power by identifying themselves with a powerful organization \nor mass movement. An individual lacking goals or power joins a movement or an organization, adopts its \ngoals as his own, then works toward those goals. When some of the goals are attained, the individual, even \nthough his personal efforts have played only an insignificant part in the attainment of the goals, feels \n(through his identification with the movement or organization) as if he had gone through the power process. \nThis phenomenon was exploited by the fascists, nazis and communists. Our society uses it too, though less \ncrudely. Example: Manuel Noriega was an irritant to the U.S. (goal: punish Noriega). The U.S. invaded \nPanama (effort) and punished Noriega (attainment of goal). Thus the U.S. went through the power process \nand many Americans, because of their identification with the U.S., experienced the power process \nvicariously. Hence the widespread public approval of the Panama invasion; it gave people a sense of power. \n[15] We see the same phenomenon in armies, corporations, political parties, humanitarian organizations, \nreligious or ideological movements. In particular, leftist movements tend to attract people who are seeking \nto satisfy their need for power. But for most people identification with a large organization or a mass \nmovement does not fully satisfy the need for power.<p>\n84. Another way in which people satisfy their need for the power process is through surrogate activities. As \nwe explained in paragraphs 38-40, a surrogate activity is an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal \nthat the individual pursues for the sake of the \u0093fulfillment\u0094 that he gets from pursuing the goal, not because \nhe needs to attain the goal itself. For instance, there is no practical motive for building enormous muscles, \nhitting a little ball into a hole or acquiring a complete series of postage stamps. Yet many people in our \nsociety devote themselves with passion to bodybuilding, golf or stamp-collecting. Some people are more \n\u0093other-directed\u0094 than others, and therefore will more readily attach importance to a surrogate activity simply \nbecause the people around them treat it as important or because society tells them it is important. That is \nwhy some people get very serious about essentially trivial activities such as sports, or bridge, or chess, or \narcane scholarly pursuits, whereas others who are more clear-sighted never see these things as anything but \nthe surrogate activities that they are, and consequently never attach enough importance to them to satisfy \ntheir need for the power process in that way. It only remains to point out that in many cases a person\u0092s way \nof earning a living is also a surrogate activity. Not a PURE surrogate activity, since part of the motive for \nthe activity is to gain the physical necessities and (for some people) social status and the luxuries that \nadvertising makes them want. But many people put into their work far more effort than is necessary to earn \nwhatever money and status they require, and this extra effort constitutes a surrogate activity. This extra \neffort, together with the emotional investment that accompanies it, is one of the most potent forces acting \ntoward the continual development and perfecting of the system, with negative consequences for individual \nfreedom (see paragraph 131). Especially, for the most creative scientists and engineers, work tends to be \nlargely a surrogate activity. This point is so important that it deserves a separate discussion, which we shall \ngive in a moment (paragraphs 87-92).<p>\n85. In this section we have explained how many people in modern society do satisfy their need for the \npower process to a greater or lesser extent. But we think that for the majority of people the need for the \npower process is not fully satisfied. In the first place, those who have an insatiable drive for status, or who \nget firmly \u0093hooked\u0094 on a surrogate activity, or who identify strongly enough with a movement or \norganization to satisfy their need for power in that way, are exceptional personalities. Others are not fully \nsatisfied with surrogate activities or by identification with an organization (see paragraphs 41, 64). In the \nsecond place, too much control is imposed by the system through explicit regulation or through \nsocialization, which results in a deficiency of autonomy, and in frustration due to the impossibility of \nattaining certain goals and the necessity of restraining too many impulses.<p>\n86. But even if most people in industrial-technological society were well satisfied, we (FC) would still be \nopposed to that form of society, because (among other reasons) we consider it demeaning to fulfill one\u0092s \nneed for the power process through surrogate activities or through identification with an organization, rather \nthan through pursuit of real goals.<p>\nTHE MOTIVES OF SCIENTISTS<p>\n87. Science and technology provide the most important examples of surrogate activities. Some scientists \nclaim that they are motivated by \u0093curiosity\u0094 or by a desire to \u0093benefit humanity.\u0094 But it is easy to see that \nneither of these can be the principal motive of most scientists. As for \u0093curiosity,\u0094 that notion is simply \nabsurd. Most scientists work on highly specialized problems that are not the object of any normal curiosity. \nFor example, is an astronomer, a mathematician or an entomologist curious about the properties of \nisopropyltrimethylmethane? Of course not. Only a chemist is curious about such a thing, and he is curious \nabout it only because chemistry is his surrogate activity. Is the chemist curious about the appropriate \nclassification of a new species of beetle? No. That question is of interest only to the entomologist, and he is \ninterested in it only because entomology is his surrogate activity. If the chemist and the entomologist had to \nexert themselves seriously to obtain the physical necessities, and if that effort exercised their abilities in an \ninteresting way but in some nonscientific pursuit, then they wouldn\u0092t give a damn about \nisopropyltrimethylmethane or the classification of beetles. Suppose that lack of funds for postgraduate \neducation had led the chemist to become an insurance broker instead of a chemist. In that case he would \nhave been very interested in insurance matters but would have cared nothing about \nisopropyltrimethylmethane. In any case it is not normal to put into the satisfaction of mere curiosity the \namount of time and effort that scientists put into their work. The \u0093curiosity\u0094 explanation for the scientists\u0092 \nmotive just doesn\u0092t stand up.<p>\n88. The \u0093benefit of humanity\u0094 explanation doesn\u0092t work any better. Some scientific work has no \nconceivable relation to the welfare of the human race\u0097most of archaeology or comparative linguistics for \nexample. Some other areas of science present obviously dangerous possibilities. Yet scientists in these areas \nare just as enthusiastic about their work as those who develop vaccines or study air pollution. Consider the \ncase of Dr. Edward Teller, who had an obvious emotional involvement in promoting nuclear power plants. \nDid this involvement stem from a desire to benefit humanity? If so, then why didn\u0092t Dr. Teller get emotional \nabout other \u0093humanitarian\u0094 causes? If he was such a humanitarian then why did he help to develop the H-\nbomb? As with many other scientific achievements, it is very much open to question whether nuclear power \nplants actually do benefit humanity. Does the cheap electricity outweigh the accumulating waste and the risk \nof accidents? Dr. Teller saw only one side of the question. Clearly his emotional involvement with nuclear \npower arose not from a desire to \u0093benefit humanity\u0094 but from a personal fulfillment he got from his work \nand from seeing it put to practical use.<p>\n89. The same is true of scientists generally. With possible rare exceptions, their motive is neither curiosity \nnor a desire to benefit humanity but the need to go through the power process: to have a goal (a scientific \nproblem to solve), to make an effort (research) and to attain the goal (solution of the problem.) Science is a \nsurrogate activity because scientists work mainly for the fulfillment they get out of the work itself.<p>\n90. Of course, it\u0092s not that simple. Other motives do play a role for many scientists. Money and status for \nexample. Some scientists may be persons of the type who have an insatiable drive for status (see paragraph \n79) and this may provide much of the motivation for their work. No doubt the majority of scientists, like the \nmajority of the general population, are more or less susceptible to advertising and marketing techniques and \nneed money to satisfy their craving for goods and services. Thus science is not a PURE surrogate activity. \nBut it is in large part a surrogate activity.<p>\n91. Also, science and technology constitute a power mass movement, and many scientists gratify their need \nfor power through identification with this mass movement (see paragraph 83).<p>\n92. Thus science marches on blindly, without regard to the real welfare of the human race or to any other \nstandard, obedient only to the psychological needs of the scientists and of the government officials and \ncorporation executives who provide the funds for research.<p>\nTHE NATURE OF FREEDOM<p>\n93. We are going to argue that industrial-technological society cannot be reformed in such a way as to \nprevent it from progressively narrowing the sphere of human freedom. But, because \u0093freedom\u0094 is a word \nthat can be interpreted in many ways, we must first make clear what kind of freedom we are concerned \nwith.<p>\n94. By \u0093freedom\u0094 we mean the opportunity to go through the power process, with real goals not the \nartificial goals of surrogate activities, and without interference, manipulation or supervision from anyone, \nespecially from any large organization. Freedom means being in control (either as an individual or as a \nmember of a SMALL group) of the life-and-death issues of one\u0092s existence; food, clothing, shelter and \ndefense against whatever threats there may be in one\u0092s environment. Freedom means having power; not the \npower to control other people but the power to control the circumstances of one\u0092s own life. One does not \nhave freedom if anyone else (especially a large organization) has power over one, no matter how \nbenevolently, tolerantly and permissively that power may be exercised. It is important not to confuse \nfreedom with mere permissiveness (see paragraph 72).<p>\n95. It is said that we live in a free society because we have a certain number of constitutionally guaranteed \nrights. But these are not as important as they seem. The degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is \ndetermined more by the economic and technological structure of the society than by its laws or its form of \ngovernment. [16] Most of the Indian nations of New England were monarchies, and many of the cities of \nthe Italian Renaissance were controlled by dictators. But in reading about these societies one gets the \nimpression that they allowed far more personal freedom than our society does. In part this was because they \nlacked efficient mechanisms for enforcing the ruler\u0092s will: There were no modern, well-organized police \nforces, no rapid long-distance communications, no surveillance cameras, no dossiers of information about \nthe lives of average citizens. Hence it was relatively easy to evade control.<p>\n96. As for our constitutional rights, consider for example that of freedom of the press. We certainly don\u0092t \nmean to knock that right; it is very important tool for limiting concentration of political power and for \nkeeping those who do have political power in line by publicly exposing any misbehavior on their part. But \nfreedom of the press is of very little use to the average citizen as an individual. The mass media are mostly \nunder the control of large organizations that are integrated into the system. Anyone who has a little money \ncan have something printed, or can distribute it on the Internet or in some such way, but what he has to say \nwill be swamped by the vast volume of material put out by the media, hence it will have no practical effect. \nTo make an impression on society with words is therefore almost impossible for most individuals and small \ngroups. Take us (FC) for example. If we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present \nwritings to a publisher, they probably would not have been accepted. If they had been been accepted and \npublished, they probably would not have attracted many readers, because it\u0092s more fun to watch the \nentertainment put out by the media than to read a sober essay. Even if these writings had had many readers, \nmost of these readers would soon have forgotten what they had read as their minds were flooded by the \nmass of material to which the media expose them. In order to get our message before the public with some \nchance of making a lasting impression, we\u0092ve had to kill people.<p>\n97. Constitutional rights are useful up to a point, but they do not serve to guarantee much more than what \nmight be called the bourgeois conception of freedom. According to the bourgeois conception, a \u0093free\u0094 man \nis essentially an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and delimited \nfreedoms; freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the social machine more than those of the \nindividual. Thus the bourgeois\u0092s \u0093free\u0094 man has economic freedom because that promotes growth and \nprogress; he has freedom of the press because public criticism restrains misbehavior by political leaders; he \nhas a right to a fair trial because imprisonment at the whim of the powerful would be bad for the system. \nThis was clearly the attitude of Simon Bolivar. To him, people deserved liberty only if they used it to \npromote progress (progress as conceived by the bourgeois). Other bourgeois thinkers have taken a similar \nview of freedom as a mere means to collective ends. Chester C. Tan, \u0093Chinese Political Thought in the \nTwentieth Century,\u0094 page 202, explains the philosophy of the Kuomintang leader Hu Han-min: \u0093An \nindividual is granted rights because he is a member of society and his community life requires such rights. \nBy community Hu meant the whole society of the nation.\u0094 And on page 259 Tan states that according to \nCarsum Chang (Chang Chun-mai, head of the State Socialist Party in China) freedom had to be used in the \ninterest of the state and of the people as a whole. But what kind of freedom does one have if one can use it \nonly as someone else prescribes? FC\u0092s conception of freedom is not that of Bolivar, Hu, Chang or other \nbourgeois theorists. The trouble with such theorists is that they have made the development and application \nof social theories their surrogate activity. Consequently the theories are designed to serve the needs of the \ntheorists more than the needs of any people who may be unlucky enough to live in a society on which the \ntheories are imposed.<p>\n98. One more point to be made in this section: It should not be assumed that a person has enough freedom \njust because he SAYS he has enough. Freedom is restricted in part by psychological controls of which \npeople are unconscious, and moreover many people\u0092s ideas of what constitutes freedom are governed more \nby social convention than by their real needs. For example, it\u0092s likely that many leftists of the oversocialized \ntype would say that most people, including themselves, are socialized too little rather than too much, yet the \noversocialized leftist pays a heavy psychological price for his high level of socialization.<p>\nSOME PRINCIPLES OF HISTORY<p>\n99. Think of history as being the sum of two components: an erratic component that consists of \nunpredictable events that follow no discernible pattern, and a regular component that consists of long-term \nhistorical trends. Here we are concerned with the long-term trends.<p>\n100. FIRST PRINCIPLE. If a SMALL change is made that affects a long-term historical trend, then the \neffect of that change will almost always be transitory\u0097the trend will soon revert to its original state. \n(Example: A reform movement designed to clean up political corruption in a society rarely has more than a \nshort-term effect; sooner or later the reformers relax and corruption creeps back in. The level of political \ncorruption in a given society tends to remain constant, or to change only slowly with the evolution of the \nsociety. Normally, a political cleanup will be permanent only if accompanied by widespread social changes; \na SMALL change in the society won\u0092t be enough.) If a small change in a long-term historical trend appears \nto be permanent, it is only because the change acts in the direction in which the trend is already moving, so \nthat the trend is not altered by only pushed a step ahead.<p>\n101. The first principle is almost a tautology. If a trend were not stable with respect to small changes, it \nwould wander at random rather than following a definite direction; in other words it would not be a long-\nterm trend at all.<p>\n102. SECOND PRINCIPLE. If a change is made that is sufficiently large to alter permanently a long-term \nhistorical trend, then it will alter the society as a whole. In other words, a society is a system in which all \nparts are interrelated, and you can\u0092t permanently change any important part without changing all other parts \nas well. <p>\n103. THIRD PRINCIPLE. If a change is made that is large enough to alter permanently a long-term trend, \nthen the consequences for the society as a whole cannot be predicted in advance. (Unless various other \nsocieties have passed through the same change and have all experienced the same consequences, in which \ncase one can predict on empirical grounds that another society that passes through the same change will be \nlike to experience similar consequences.)<p>\n104. FOURTH PRINCIPLE. A new kind of society cannot be designed on paper. That is, you cannot plan \nout a new form of society in advance, then set it up and expect it to function as it was designed to do.<p>\n105. The third and fourth principles result from the complexity of human societies. A change in human \nbehavior will affect the economy of a society and its physical environment; the economy will affect the \nenvironment and vice versa, and the changes in the economy and the environment will affect human \nbehavior in complex, unpredictable ways; and so forth. The network of causes and effects is far too \ncomplex to be untangled and understood.<p>\n106. FIFTH PRINCIPLE. People do not consciously and rationally choose the form of their society. \nSocieties develop through processes of social evolution that are not under rational human control.<p>\n107. The fifth principle is a consequence of the other four.<p>\n108. To illustrate: By the first principle, generally speaking an attempt at social reform either acts in the \ndirection in which the society is developing anyway (so that it merely accelerates a change that would have \noccurred in any case) or else it has only a transitory effect, so that the society soon slips back into its old \ngroove. To make a lasting change in the direction of development of any important aspect of a society, \nreform is insufficient and revolution is required. (A revolution does not necessarily involve an armed \nuprising or the overthrow of a government.) By the second principle, a revolution never changes only one \naspect of a society, it changes the whole society; and by the third principle changes occur that were never \nexpected or desired by the revolutionaries. By the fourth principle, when revolutionaries or utopians set up a \nnew kind of society, it never works out as planned.<p>\n109. The American Revolution does not provide a counterexample. The American \u0093Revolution\u0094 was not a \nrevolution in our sense of the word, but a war of independence followed by a rather far-reaching political \nreform. The Founding Fathers did not change the direction of development of American society, nor did \nthey aspire to do so. They only freed the development of American society from the retarding effect of \nBritish rule. Their political reform did not change any basic trend, but only pushed American political \nculture along its natural direction of development. British society, of which American society was an \noffshoot, had been moving for a long time in the direction of representative democracy. And prior to the \nWar of Independence the Americans were already practicing a significant degree of representative \ndemocracy in the colonial assemblies. The political system established by the Constitution was modeled on \nthe British system and on the colonial assemblies. With major alteration, to be sure\u0097there is no doubt that \nthe Founding Fathers took a very important step. But it was a step along the road that English-speaking \nworld was already traveling. The proof is that Britain and all of its colonies that were populated \npredominantly by people of British descent ended up with systems of representative democracy essentially \nsimilar to that of the United States. If the Founding Fathers had lost their nerve and declined to sign the \nDeclaration of Independence, our way of life today would not have been significantly different. Maybe we \nwould have had somewhat closer ties to Britain, and would have had a Parliament and Prime Minister \ninstead of a Congress and President. No big deal. Thus the American Revolution provides not a \ncounterexample to our principles but a good illustration of them.<p>\n110. Still, one has to use common sense in applying the principles. They are expressed in imprecise \nlanguage that allows latitude for interpretation, and exceptions to them can be found. So we present these \nprinciples not as inviolable laws but as rules of thumb, or guides to thinking, that may provide a partial \nantidote to naive ideas about the future of society. The principles should be borne constantly in mind, and \nwhenever one reaches a conclusion that conflicts with them one should carefully reexamine one\u0092s thinking \nand retain the conclusion only if one has good, solid reasons for doing so.<p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<table width=\"580\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td width=\"20\"><IMG src=\"/wp-srv/images/common/clearspc.gif\" width=\"20\" height=\"1\">\n</td>\n<td>\nINDUSTRIAL-TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY CANNOT BE REFORMED<p>\n111. The foregoing principles help to show how hopelessly difficult it would be to reform the industrial \nsystem in such a way as to prevent it from progressively narrowing our sphere of freedom. There has been a \nconsistent tendency, going back at least to the Industrial Revolution for technology to strengthen the system \nat a high cost in individual freedom and local autonomy. Hence any change designed to protect freedom \nfrom technology would be contrary to a fundamental trend in the development of our society. Consequently, \nsuch a change either would be a transitory one\u0097soon swamped by the tide of history\u0097or, if large enough \nto be permanent would alter the nature of our whole society. This by the first and second principles. \nMoreover, since society would be altered in a way that could not be predicted in advance (third principle) \nthere would be great risk. Changes large enough to make a lasting difference in favor of freedom would not \nbe initiated because it would be realized that they would gravely disrupt the system. So any attempts at \nreform would be too timid to be effective. Even if changes large enough to make a lasting difference were \ninitiated, they would be retracted when their disruptive effects became apparent. Thus, permanent changes \nin favor of freedom could be brought about only by persons prepared to accept radical, dangerous and \nunpredictable alteration of the entire system. In other words by revolutionaries, not reformers.<p>\n112. People anxious to rescue freedom without sacrificing the supposed benefits of technology will suggest \nnaive schemes for some new form of society that would reconcile freedom with technology. Apart from the \nfact that people who make such suggestions seldom propose any practical means by which the new form of \nsociety could be set up in the first place, it follows from the fourth principle that even if the new form of \nsociety could be once established, it either would collapse or would give results very different from those \nexpected.<p>\n113. So even on very general grounds it seems highly improbable that any way of changing society could be \nfound that would reconcile freedom with modern technology. In the next few sections we will give more \nspecific reasons for concluding that freedom and technological progress are incompatible.<p>\nRESTRICTION OF FREEDOM IS UNAVOIDABLE IN INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY<p>\n114. As explained in paragraphs 65-67, 70-73, modern man is strapped down by a network of rules and \nregulations, and his fate depends on the actions of persons remote from him whose decisions he cannot \ninfluence. This is not accidental or a result of the arbitrariness of arrogant bureaucrats. It is necessary and \ninevitable in any technologically advanced society. The system HAS TO regulate human behavior closely in \norder to function. At work people have to do what they are told to do, otherwise production would be \nthrown into chaos. Bureaucracies HAVE TO be run according to rigid rules. To allow any substantial \npersonal discretion to lower-level bureaucrats would disrupt the system and lead to charges of unfairness \ndue to differences in the way individual bureaucrats exercised their discretion. It is true that some \nrestrictions on our freedom could be eliminated, but GENERALLY SPEAKING the regulation of our lives \nby large organizations is necessary for the functioning of industrial-technological society. The result is a \nsense of powerlessness on the part of the average person. It may be, however, that formal regulations will \ntend increasingly to be replaced by psychological tools that make us want to do what the system requires of \nus. (Propaganda [14], educational techniques, \u0093mental health\u0094 programs, etc.)<p>\n115. The system HAS TO force people to behave in ways that are increasingly remote from the natural \npattern of human behavior. For example, the system needs scientists, mathematicians and engineers. It can\u0092t \nfunction without them. So heavy pressure is put on children to excel in these fields. It isn\u0092t natural for an \nadolescent human being to spend the bulk of his time sitting at a desk absorbed in study. A normal \nadolescent wants to spend his time in active contact with the real world. Among primitive peoples the things \nthat children are trained to do tend to be in reasonable harmony with natural human impulses. Among the \nAmerican Indians, for example, boys were trained in active outdoor pursuits\u0097<p>\njust the sort of thing that boys like. But in our society children are pushed into studying technical subjects, \nwhich most do grudgingly.<p>\n116. Because of the constant pressure that the system exerts to modify human behavior, there is a gradual \nincrease in the number of people who cannot or will not adjust to society\u0092s requirements: welfare leeches, \nyouth-gang members, cultists, anti-government rebels, radical environmentalist saboteurs, dropouts and \nresisters of various kinds.<p>\n117. In any technologically advanced society the individual\u0092s fate MUST depend on decisions that he \npersonally cannot influence to any great extent. A technological society cannot be broken down into small, \nautonomous communities, because production depends on the cooperation of very large numbers of people \nand machines. Such a society MUST be highly organized and decisions HAVE TO be made that affect very \nlarge numbers of people. When a decision affects, say, a million people, then each of the affected \nindividuals has, on the average, only a one-millionth share in making the decision. What usually happens in \npractice is that decisions are made by public officials or corporation executives, or by technical specialists, \nbut even when the public votes on a decision the number of voters ordinarily is too large for the vote of any \none individual to be significant. [17] Thus most individuals are unable to influence measurably the major \ndecisions that affect their lives. There is no conceivable way to remedy this in a technologically advanced \nsociety. The system tries to \u0093solve\u0094 this problem by using propaganda to make people WANT the decisions \nthat have been made for them, but even if this \u0093solution\u0094 were completely successful in making people feel \nbetter, it would be demeaning.<p>\n118. Conservatives and some others advocate more \u0093local autonomy.\u0094 Local communities once did have \nautonomy, but such autonomy becomes less and less possible as local communities become more enmeshed \nwith and dependent on large-scale systems like public utilities, computer networks, highway systems, the \nmass communications media, the modern health care system. Also operating against autonomy is the fact \nthat technology applied in one location often affects people at other locations far way. Thus pesticide or \nchemical use near a creek may contaminate the water supply hundreds of miles downstream, and the \ngreenhouse effect affects the whole world.<p>\n119. The system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human needs. Instead, it is human behavior that has to \nbe modified to fit the needs of the system. This has nothing to do with the political or social ideology that \nmay pretend to guide the technological system. It is the fault of technology, because the system is guided \nnot by ideology but by technical necessity. [18] Of course the system does satisfy many human needs, but \ngenerally speaking it does this only to the extend that it is to the advantage of the system to do it. It is the \nneeds of the system that are paramount, not those of the human being. For example, the system provides \npeople with food because the system couldn\u0092t function if everyone starved; it attends to people\u0092s \npsychological needs whenever it can CONVENIENTLY do so, because it couldn\u0092t function if too many \npeople became depressed or rebellious. But the system, for good, solid, practical reasons, must exert \nconstant pressure on people to mold their behavior to the needs of the system. To much waste \naccumulating? The government, the media, the educational system, environmentalists, everyone inundates \nus with a mass of propaganda about recycling. Need more technical personnel? A chorus of voices exhorts \nkids to study science. No one stops to ask whether it is inhumane to force adolescents to spend the bulk of \ntheir time studying subjects most of them hate. When skilled workers are put out of a job by technical \nadvances and have to undergo \u0093retraining,\u0094 no one asks whether it is humiliating for them to be pushed \naround in this way. It is simply taken for granted that everyone must bow to technical necessity. and for \ngood reason: If human needs were put before technical necessity there would be economic problems, \nunemployment, shortages or worse. The concept of \u0093mental health\u0094 in our society is defined largely by the \nextent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing \nsigns of stress.<p>\n120. Efforts to make room for a sense of purpose and for autonomy within the system are no better than a \njoke. For example, one company, instead of having each of its employees assemble only one section of a \ncatalogue, had each assemble a whole catalogue, and this was supposed to give them a sense of purpose and \nachievement. Some companies have tried to give their employees more autonomy in their work, but for \npractical reasons this usually can be done only to a very limited extent, and in any case employees are never \ngiven autonomy as to ultimate goals\u0097their \u0093autonomous\u0094 efforts can never be directed toward goals that \nthey select personally, but only toward their employer\u0092s goals, such as the survival and growth of the \ncompany. Any company would soon go out of business if it permitted its employees to act otherwise. \nSimilarly, in any enterprise within a socialist system, workers must direct their efforts toward the goals of \nthe enterprise, otherwise the enterprise will not serve its purpose as part of the system. Once again, for \npurely technical reasons it is not possible for most individuals or small groups to have much autonomy in \nindustrial society. Even the small-business owner commonly has only limited autonomy. Apart from the \nnecessity of government regulation, he is restricted by the fact that he must fit into the economic system and \nconform to its requirements. For instance, when someone develops a new technology, the small-business \nperson often has to use that technology whether he wants to or not, in order to remain competitive.<p>\nTHE \u0091BAD\u0092 PARTS OF TECHNOLOGY CANNOT BE SEPARATED FROM THE \u0091GOOD\u0092 PARTS<p>\n121. A further reason why industrial society cannot be reformed in favor of freedom is that modern \ntechnology is a unified system in which all parts are dependent on one another. You can\u0092t get rid of the \n\u0093bad\u0094 parts of technology and retain only the \u0093good\u0094 parts. Take modern medicine, for example. Progress in \nmedical science depends on progress in chemistry, physics, biology, computer science and other fields. \nAdvanced medical treatments require expensive, high-tech equipment that can be made available only by a \ntechnologically progressive, economically rich society. Clearly you can\u0092t have much progress in medicine \nwithout the whole technological system and everything that goes with it.<p>\n122. Even if medical progress could be maintained without the rest of the technological system, it would by \nitself bring certain evils. Suppose for example that a cure for diabetes is discovered. People with a genetic \ntendency to diabetes will then be able to survive and reproduce as well as anyone else. Natural selection \nagainst genes for diabetes will cease and such genes will spread throughout the population. (This may be \noccurring to some extent already, since diabetes, while not curable, can be controlled through use of \ninsulin.) The same thing will happen with many other diseases susceptibility to which is affected by genetic \ndegradation of the population. The only solution will be some sort of eugenics program or extensive genetic \nengineering of human beings, so that man in the future will no longer be a creation of nature, or of chance, \nor of God (depending on your religious or philosophical opinions), but a manufactured product.<p>\n123. If you think that big government interferes in your life too much NOW, just wait till the government \nstarts regulating the genetic constitution of your children. Such regulation will inevitably follow the \nintroduction of genetic engineering of human beings, because the consequences of unregulated genetic \nengineering would be disastrous. [19]<p>\n124. The usual response to such concerns is to talk about \u0093medical ethics.\u0094 But a code of ethics would not \nserve to protect freedom in the face of medical progress; it would only make matters worse. A code of \nethics applicable to genetic engineering would be in effect a means of regulating the genetic constitution of \nhuman beings. Somebody (probably the upper-middle class, mostly) would decide that such and such \napplications of genetic engineering were \u0093ethical\u0094 and others were not, so that in effect they would be \nimposing their own values on the genetic constitution of the population at large. Even if a code of ethics \nwere chosen on a completely democratic basis, the majority would be imposing their own values on any \nminorities who might have a different idea of what constituted an \u0093ethical\u0094 use of genetic engineering. The \nonly code of ethics that would truly protect freedom would be one that prohibited ANY genetic engineering \nof human beings, and you can be sure that no such code will ever be applied in a technological society. No \ncode that reduced genetic engineering to a minor role could stand up for long, because the temptation \npresented by the immense power of biotechnology would be irresistible, especially since to the majority of \npeople many of its applications will seem obviously and unequivocally good (eliminating physical and \nmental diseases, giving people the abilities they need to get along in today\u0092s world). Inevitably, genetic \nengineering will be used extensively, but only in ways consistent with the needs of the industrial-\ntechnological system. [20]<p>\nTECHNOLOGY IS A MORE POWERFUL SOCIAL FORCE THAN THE ASPIRATION FOR \nFREEDOM<p>\n125. It is not possible to make a LASTING compromise between technology and freedom, because \ntechnology is by far the more powerful social force and continually encroaches on freedom through \nREPEATED compromises. Imagine the case of two neighbors, each of whom at the outset owns the same \namount of land, but one of whom is more powerful than the other. The powerful one demands a piece of the \nother\u0092s land. The weak one refuses. The powerful one says, \u0093OK, let\u0092s compromise. Give me half of what I \nasked.\u0094 The weak one has little choice but to give in. Some time later the powerful neighbor demands \nanother piece of land, again there is a compromise, and so forth. By forcing a long series of compromises \non the weaker man, the powerful one eventually gets all of his land. So it goes in the conflict between \ntechnology and freedom.<p>\n126. Let us explain why technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for freedom.<p>\n127. A technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom often turns out to threaten it very \nseriously later on. For example, consider motorized transport. A walking man formerly could go where he \npleased, go at his own pace without observing any traffic regulations, and was independent of technological \nsupport-systems. When motor vehicles were introduced they appeared to increase man\u0092s freedom. They \ntook no freedom away from the walking man, no one had to have an automobile if he didn\u0092t want one, and \nanyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster and farther than a walking man. But \nthe introduction of motorized transport soon changed society in such a way as to restrict greatly man\u0092s \nfreedom of locomotion. When automobiles became numerous, it became necessary to regulate their use \nextensively. In a car, especially in densely populated areas, one cannot just go where one likes at one\u0092s own \npace one\u0092s movement is governed by the flow of traffic and by various traffic laws. One is tied down by \nvarious obligations: license requirements, driver test, renewing registration, insurance, maintenance \nrequired for safety, monthly payments on purchase price. Moreover, the use of motorized transport is no \nlonger optional. Since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in \nsuch a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of their place of employment, \nshopping areas and recreational opportunities, so that they HAVE TO depend on the automobile for \ntransportation. Or else they must use public transportation, in which case they have even less control over \ntheir own movement than when driving a car. Even the walker\u0092s freedom is now greatly restricted. In the \ncity he continually has to stop to wait for traffic lights that are designed mainly to serve auto traffic. In the \ncountry, motor traffic makes it dangerous and unpleasant to walk along the highway. (Note this important \npoint that we have just illustrated with the case of motorized transport: When a new item of technology is \nintroduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses, it does not necessarily REMAIN \noptional. In many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find \nthemselves FORCED to use it.)<p>\n128. While technological progress AS A WHOLE continually narrows our sphere of freedom, each new \ntechnical advance CONSIDERED BY ITSELF appears to be desirable. Electricity, indoor plumbing, rapid \nlong-distance communications ... how could one argue against any of these things, or against any other of \nthe innumerable technical advances that have made modern society? It would have been absurd to resist the \nintroduction of the telephone, for example. It offered many advantages and no disadvantages. Yet, as we \nexplained in paragraphs 59-76, all these technical advances taken together have created a world in which \nthe average man\u0092s fate is no longer in his own hands or in the hands of his neighbors and friends, but in \nthose of politicians, corporation executives and remote, anonymous technicians and bureaucrats whom he as \nan individual has no power to influence. [21] The same process will continue in the future. Take genetic \nengineering, for example. Few people will resist the introduction of a genetic technique that eliminates a \nhereditary disease. It does no apparent harm and prevents much suffering. Yet a large number of genetic \nimprovements taken together will make the human being into an engineered product rather than a free \ncreation of chance (or of God, or whatever, depending on your religious beliefs).<p>\n129. Another reason why technology is such a powerful social force is that, within the context of a given \nsociety, technological progress marches in only one direction; it can never be reversed. Once a technical \ninnovation has been introduced, people usually become dependent on it, so that they can never again do \nwithout it, unless it is replaced by some still more advanced innovation. Not only do people become \ndependent as individuals on a new item of technology, but, even more, the system as a whole becomes \ndependent on it. (Imagine what would happen to the system today if computers, for example, were \neliminated.) Thus the system can move in only one direction, toward greater technologization. Technology \nrepeatedly forces freedom to take a step back, but technology can never take a step back\u0097short of the \noverthrow of the whole technological system.<p>\n130. Technology advances with great rapidity and threatens freedom at many different points at the same \ntime (crowding, rules and regulations, increasing dependence of individuals on large organizations, \npropaganda and other psychological techniques, genetic engineering, invasion of privacy through \nsurveillance devices and computers, etc.). To hold back any ONE of the threats to freedom would require a \nlong and difficult social struggle. Those who want to protect freedom are overwhelmed by the sheer number \nof new attacks and the rapidity with which they develop, hence they become apathetic and no longer resist. \nTo fight each of the threats separately would be futile. Success can be hoped for only by fighting the \ntechnological system as a whole; but that is revolution, not reform.<p>\n131. Technicians (we use this term in its broad sense to describe all those who perform a specialized task \nthat requires training) tend to be so involved in their work (their surrogate activity) that when a conflict \narises between their technical work and freedom, they almost always decide in favor of their technical work. \nThis is obvious in the case of scientists, but it also appears elsewhere: Educators, humanitarian groups, \nconservation organizations do not hesitate to use propaganda or other psychological techniques to help them \nachieve their laudable ends. Corporations and government agencies, when they find it useful, do not hesitate \nto collect information about individuals without regard to their privacy. Law enforcement agencies are \nfrequently inconvenienced by the constitutional rights of suspects and often of completely innocent persons, \nand they do whatever they can do legally (or sometimes illegally) to restrict or circumvent those rights. \nMost of these educators, government officials and law officers believe in freedom, privacy and \nconstitutional rights, but when these conflict with their work, they usually feel that their work is more \nimportant.<p>\n132. It is well known that people generally work better and more persistently when striving for a reward \nthan when attempting to avoid a punishment or negative outcome. Scientists and other technicians are \nmotivated mainly by the rewards they get through their work. But those who oppose technological invasions \nof freedom are working to avoid a negative outcome, consequently there are few who work persistently and \nwell at this discouraging task. If reformers ever achieved a signal victory that seemed to set up a solid \nbarrier against further erosion of freedom through technical progress, most would tend to relax and turn \ntheir attention to more agreeable pursuits. But the scientists would remain busy in their laboratories, and \ntechnology as it progresses would find ways, in spite of any barriers, to exert more and more control over \nindividuals and make them always more dependent on the system.<p>\n133. No social arrangements, whether laws, institutions, customs or ethical codes, can provide permanent \nprotection against technology. History shows that all social arrangements are transitory; they all change or \nbreak down eventually. But technological advances are permanent within the context of a given civilization. \nSuppose for example that it were possible to arrive at some social arrangements that would prevent genetic \nengineering from being applied to human beings, or prevent it from being applied in such a way as to \nthreaten freedom and dignity. Still, the technology would remain waiting. Sooner or later the social \narrangement would break down. Probably sooner, given the pace of change in our society. Then genetic \nengineering would begin to invade our sphere of freedom, and this invasion would be irreversible (short of a \nbreakdown of technological civilization itself). Any illusions about achieving anything permanent through \nsocial arrangements should be dispelled by what is currently happening with environmental legislation. A \nfew years ago its seemed that there were secure legal barriers preventing at least SOME of the worst forms \nof environmental degradation. A change in the political wind, and those barriers begin to crumble.<p>\n134. For all of the foregoing reasons, technology is a more powerful social force than the aspiration for \nfreedom. But this statement requires an important qualification. It appears that during the next several \ndecades the industrial-technological system will be undergoing severe stresses due to economic and \nenvironmental problems, and especially due to problems of human behavior (alienation, rebellion, hostility, \na variety of social and psychological difficulties). We hope that the stresses through which the system is \nlikely to pass will cause it to break down, or at least will weaken it sufficiently so that a revolution against it \nbecomes possible. If such a revolution occurs and is successful, then at that particular moment the aspiration \nfor freedom will have proved more powerful than technology.<p>\n135. In paragraph 125 we used an analogy of a weak neighbor who is left destitute by a strong neighbor \nwho takes all his land by forcing on him a series of compromises. But suppose now that the strong neighbor \ngets sick, so that he is unable to defend himself. The weak neighbor can force the strong one to give him his \nland back, or he can kill him. If he lets the strong man survive and only forces him to give the land back, he \nis a fool, because when the strong man gets well he will again take all the land for himself. The only \nsensible alternative for the weaker man is to kill the strong one while he has the chance. In the same way, \nwhile the industrial system is sick we must destroy it. If we compromise with it and let it recover from its \nsickness, it will eventually wipe out all of our freedom.<p>\nSIMPLER SOCIAL PROBLEMS HAVE PROVED INTRACTABLE<p>\n136. If anyone still imagines that it would be possible to reform the system in such a way as to protect \nfreedom from technology, let him consider how clumsily and for the most part unsuccessfully our society \nhas dealt with other social problems that are far more simple and straightforward. Among other things, the \nsystem has failed to stop environmental degradation, political corruption, drug trafficking or domestic \nabuse.<p>\n137. Take our environmental problems, for example. Here the conflict of values is straightforward: \neconomic expedience now versus saving some of our natural resources for our grandchildren. [22] But on \nthis subject we get only a lot of blather and obfuscation from the people who have power, and nothing like a \nclear, consistent line of action, and we keep on piling up environmental problems that our grandchildren \nwill have to live with. Attempts to resolve the environmental issue consist of struggles and compromises \nbetween different factions, some of which are ascendant at one moment, others at another moment. The line \nof struggle changes with the shifting currents of public opinion. This is not a rational process, nor is it one \nthat is likely to lead to a timely and successful solution to the problem. Major social problems, if they get \n\u0093solved\u0094 at all, are rarely or never solved through any rational, comprehensive plan. They just work \nthemselves out through a process in which various competing groups pursuing their own (usually short-\nterm) self-interest [23] arrive (mainly by luck) at some more or less stable modus vivendi. In fact, the \nprinciples we formulated in paragraphs 100-106 make it seem doubtful that rational, long-term social \nplanning can EVER be successful.<p>\n138. Thus it is clear that the human race has at best a very limited capacity for solving even relatively \nstraightforward social problems. How then is it going to solve the far more difficult and subtle problem of \nreconciling freedom with technology? Technology presents clear-cut material advantages, whereas freedom \nis an abstraction that means different things to different people, and its loss is easily obscured by \npropaganda and fancy talk.<p>\n139. And note this important difference: It is conceivable that our environmental problems (for example) \nmay some day be settled through a rational, comprehensive plan, but if this happens it will be only because \nit is in the long-term interest of the system to solve these problems. But it is NOT in the interest of the \nsystem to preserve freedom or small-group autonomy. On the contrary, it is in the interest of the system to \nbring human behavior under control to the greatest possible extent. [24] Thus, while practical \nconsiderations may eventually force the system to take a rational, prudent approach to environmental \nproblems, equally practical considerations will force the system to regulate human behavior ever more \nclosely (preferably by indirect means that will disguise the encroachment on freedom). This isn\u0092t just our \nopinion. Eminent social scientists (e.g. James Q. Wilson) have stressed the importance of \u0093socializing\u0094 \npeople more effectively.<p>\nREVOLUTION IS EASIER THAN REFORM<p>\n140. We hope we have convinced the reader that the system cannot be reformed in such a way as to \nreconcile freedom with technology. The only way out is to dispense with the industrial-technological system \naltogether. This implies revolution, not necessarily an armed uprising, but certainly a radical and \nfundamental change in the nature of society.<p>\n141. People tend to assume that because a revolution involves a much greater change than reform does, it is \nmore difficult to bring about than reform is. Actually, under certain circumstances revolution is much easier \nthan reform. The reason is that a revolutionary movement can inspire an intensity of commitment that a \nreform movement cannot inspire. A reform movement merely offers to solve a particular social problem. A \nrevolutionary movement offers to solve all problems at one stroke and create a whole new world; it provides \nthe kind of ideal for which people will take great risks and make great sacrifices. For this reasons it would \nbe much easier to overthrow the whole technological system than to put effective, permanent restraints on \nthe development or application of any one segment of technology, such as genetic engineering, for example. \nNot many people will devote themselves with single-minded passion to imposing and maintaining restraints \non genetic engineering, but under suitable conditions large numbers of people may devote themselves \npassionately to a revolution against the industrial-technological system. As we noted in paragraph 132, \nreformers seeking to limit certain aspects of technology would be working to avoid a negative outcome. But \nrevolutionaries work to gain a powerful reward\u0097fulfillment of their revolutionary vision\u0097and therefore \nwork harder and more persistently than reformers do.<p>\n142. Reform is always restrained by the fear of painful consequences if changes go too far. But once a \nrevolutionary fever has taken hold of a society, people are willing to undergo unlimited hardships for the \nsake of their revolution. This was clearly shown in the French and Russian Revolutions. It may be that in \nsuch cases only a minority of the population is really committed to the revolution, but this minority is \nsufficiently large and active so that it becomes the dominant force in society. We will have more to say \nabout revolution in paragraphs 180-205.<p>\nCONTROL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR<p>\n143. Since the beginning of civilization, organized societies have had to put pressures on human beings of \nthe sake of the functioning of the social organism. The kinds of pressures vary greatly from one society to \nanother. Some of the pressures are physical (poor diet, excessive labor, environmental pollution), some are \npsychological (noise, crowding, forcing human behavior into the mold that society requires). In the past, \nhuman nature has been approximately constant, or at any rate has varied only within certain bounds. \nConsequently, societies have been able to push people only up to certain limits. When the limit of human \nendurance has been passed, things start going wrong: rebellion, or crime, or corruption, or evasion of work, \nor depression and other mental problems, or an elevated death rate, or a declining birth rate or something \nelse, so that either the society breaks down, or its functioning becomes too inefficient and it is (quickly or \ngradually, through conquest, attrition or evolution) replaced by some more efficient form of society. \n[25]<p>\n144. Thus human nature has in the past put certain limits on the development of societies. People could be \npushed only so far and no farther. But today this may be changing, because modern technology is \ndeveloping ways of modifying human beings.<p>\n145. Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, then gives them \ndrugs to take away their unhappiness. Science fiction? It is already happening to some extent in our own \nsociety. It is well known that the rate of clinical depression has been greatly increasing in recent decades. \nWe believe that this is due to disruption of the power process, as explained in paragraphs 59-76. But even if \nwe are wrong, the increasing rate of depression is certainly the result of SOME conditions that exist in \ntoday\u0092s society. Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them \nantidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual\u0092s internal state in \nsuch a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable. (Yes, we \nknow that depression is often of purely genetic origin. We are referring here to those cases in which \nenvironment plays the predominant role.)<p>\n146. Drugs that affect the mind are only one example of the new methods of controlling human behavior \nthat modern society is developing. Let us look at some of the other methods.<p>\n147. To start with, there are the techniques of surveillance. Hidden video cameras are now used in most \nstores and in many other places, computers are used to collect and process vast amounts of information \nabout individuals. Information so obtained greatly increases the effectiveness of physical coercion (i.e., law \nenforcement). [26] Then there are the methods of propaganda, for which the mass communication media \nprovide effective vehicles. Efficient techniques have been developed for winning elections, selling products, \ninfluencing public opinion. The entertainment industry serves as an important psychological tool of the \nsystem, possibly even when it is dishing out large amounts of sex and violence. Entertainment provides \nmodern man with an essential means of escape. While absorbed in television, videos, etc., he can forget \nstress, anxiety, frustration, dissatisfaction. Many primitive peoples, when they don\u0092t have work to do, are \nquite content to sit for hours at a time doing nothing at all, because they are at peace with themselves and \ntheir world. But most modern people must be constantly occupied or entertained, otherwise they get \n\u0093bored,\u0094 i.e., they get fidgety, uneasy, irritable.<p>\n148. Other techniques strike deeper than the foregoing. Education is no longer a simple affair of paddling a \nkid\u0092s behind when he doesn\u0092t know his lessons and patting him on the head when he does know them. It is \nbecoming a scientific technique for controlling the child\u0092s development. Sylvan Learning Centers, for \nexample, have had great success in motivating children to study, and psychological techniques are also used \nwith more or less success in many conventional schools. \u0093Parenting\u0094 techniques that are taught to parents \nare designed to make children accept fundamental values of the system and behave in ways that the system \nfinds desirable. \u0093Mental health\u0094 programs, \u0093intervention\u0094 techniques, psychotherapy and so forth are \nostensibly designed to benefit individuals, but in practice they usually serve as methods for inducing \nindividuals to think and behave as the system requires. (There is no contradiction here; an individual whose \nattitudes or behavior bring him into conflict with the system is up against a force that is too powerful for \nhim to conquer or escape from, hence he is likely to suffer from stress, frustration, defeat. His path will be \nmuch easier if he thinks and behaves as the system requires. In that sense the system is acting for the benefit \nof the individual when it brainwashes him into conformity.) Child abuse in its gross and obvious forms is \ndisapproved in most if not all cultures. Tormenting a child for a trivial reason or no reason at all is \nsomething that appalls almost everyone. But many psychologists interpret the concept of abuse much more \nbroadly. Is spanking, when used as part of a rational and consistent system of discipline, a form of abuse? \nThe question will ultimately be decided by whether or not spanking tends to produce behavior that makes a \nperson fit in well with the existing system of society. In practice, the word \u0093abuse\u0094 tends to be interpreted to \ninclude any method of child-rearing that produces behavior inconvenient for the system. Thus, when they go \nbeyond the prevention of obvious, senseless cruelty, programs for preventing \u0093child abuse\u0094 are directed \ntoward the control of human behavior on behalf of the system.<p>\n149. Presumably, research will continue to increase the effectiveness of psychological techniques for \ncontrolling human behavior. But we think it is unlikely that psychological techniques alone will be \nsufficient to adjust human beings to the kind of society that technology is creating. Biological methods \nprobably will have to be used. We have already mentioned the use of drugs in this connection. Neurology \nmay provide other avenues for modifying the human mind. Genetic engineering of human beings is already \nbeginning to occur in the form of \u0093gene therapy,\u0094 and there is no reason to assume that such methods will \nnot eventually be used to modify those aspects of the body that affect mental functioning.<p>\n150. As we mentioned in paragraph 134, industrial society seems likely to be entering a period of severe \nstress, due in part to problems of human behavior and in part to economic and environmental problems. \nAnd a considerable proportion of the system\u0092s economic and environmental problems result from the way \nhuman beings behave. Alienation, low self-esteem, depression, hostility, rebellion; children who won\u0092t \nstudy, youth gangs, illegal drug use, rape, child abuse, other crimes, unsafe sex, teen pregnancy, population \ngrowth, political corruption, race hatred, ethnic rivalry, bitter ideological conflict (e.g., pro-choice vs. pro-\nlife), political extremism, terrorism, sabotage, anti-government groups, hate groups. All these threaten the \nvery survival of the system. The system will therefore be FORCED to use every practical means of \ncontrolling human behavior.<p>\n151. The social disruption that we see today is certainly not the result of mere chance. It can only be a result \nof the conditions of life that the system imposes on people. (We have argued that the most important of \nthese conditions is disruption of the power process.) If the systems succeeds in imposing sufficient control \nover human behavior to assure its own survival, a new watershed in human history will have been passed. \nWhereas formerly the limits of human endurance have imposed limits on the development of societies (as \nwe explained in paragraphs 143, 144), industrial-technological society will be able to pass those limits by \nmodifying human beings, whether by psychological methods or biological methods or both. In the future, \nsocial systems will not be adjusted to suit the needs of human beings. Instead, human being will be adjusted \nto suit the needs of the system. [27]<p>\n152. Generally speaking, technological control over human behavior will probably not be introduced with a \ntotalitarian intention or even through a conscious desire to restrict human freedom. [28] Each new step in \nthe assertion of control over the human mind will be taken as a rational response to a problem that faces \nsociety, such as curing alcoholism, reducing the crime rate or inducing young people to study science and \nengineering. In many cases there will be a humanitarian justification. For example, when a psychiatrist \nprescribes an anti-depressant for a depressed patient, he is clearly doing that individual a favor. It would be \ninhumane to withhold the drug from someone who needs it. When parents send their children to Sylvan \nLearning Centers to have them manipulated into becoming enthusiastic about their studies, they do so from \nconcern for their children\u0092s welfare. It may be that some of these parents wish that one didn\u0092t have to have \nspecialized training to get a job and that their kid didn\u0092t have to be brainwashed into becoming a computer \nnerd. But what can they do? They can\u0092t change society, and their child may be unemployable if he doesn\u0092t \nhave certain skills. So they send him to Sylvan.<p>\n153. Thus control over human behavior will be introduced not by a calculated decision of the authorities but \nthrough a process of social evolution (RAPID evolution, however). The process will be impossible to resist, \nbecause each advance, considered by itself, will appear to be beneficial, or at least the evil involved in \nmaking the advance will appear to be beneficial, or at least the evil involved in making the advance will \nseem to be less than that which would result from not making it (see paragraph 127). Propaganda for \nexample is used for many good purposes, such as discouraging child abuse or race hatred. [14] Sex \neducation is obviously useful, yet the effect of sex education (to the extent that it is successful) is to take the \nshaping of sexual attitudes away from the family and put it into the hands of the state as represented by the \npublic school system.<p>\n154. Suppose a biological trait is discovered that increases the likelihood that a child will grow up to be a \ncriminal, and suppose some sort of gene therapy can remove this trait. [29] Of course most parents whose \nchildren possess the trait will have them undergo the therapy. It would be inhumane to do otherwise, since \nthe child would probably have a miserable life if he grew up to be a criminal. But many or most primitive \nsocieties have a low crime rate in comparison with that of our society, even though they have neither high-\ntech methods of child-rearing nor harsh systems of punishment. Since there is no reason to suppose that \nmore modern men than primitive men have innate predatory tendencies, the high crime rate of our society \nmust be due to the pressures that modern conditions put on people, to which many cannot or will not adjust. \nThus a treatment designed to remove potential criminal tendencies is at least in part a way of re-engineering \npeople so that they suit the requirements of the system.<p>\n155. Our society tends to regard as a \u0093sickness\u0094 any mode of thought or behavior that is inconvenient for \nthe system, and this is plausible because when an individual doesn\u0092t fit into the system it causes pain to the \nindividual as well as problems for the system. Thus the manipulation of an individual to adjust him to the \nsystem is seen as a \u0093cure\u0094 for a \u0093sickness\u0094 and therefore as good.<p>\n156. In paragraph 127 we pointed out that if the use of a new item of technology is INITIALLY optional, it \ndoes not necessarily REMAIN optional, because the new technology tends to change society in such a way \nthat it becomes difficult or impossible for an individual to function without using that technology. This \napplies also to the technology of human behavior. In a world in which most children are put through a \nprogram to make them enthusiastic about studying, a parent will almost be forced to put his kid through \nsuch a program, because if he does not, then the kid will grow up to be, comparatively speaking, an \nignoramus and therefore unemployable. Or suppose a biological treatment is discovered that, without \nundesirable side-effects, will greatly reduce the psychological stress from which so many people suffer in \nour society. If large numbers of people choose to undergo the treatment, then the general level of stress in \nsociety will be reduced, so that it will be possible for the system to increase the stress-producing pressures. \nIn fact, something like this seems to have happened already with one of our society\u0092s most important \npsychological tools for enabling people to reduce (or at least temporarily escape from) stress, namely, mass \nentertainment (see paragraph 147). Our use of mass entertainment is \u0093optional\u0094: No law requires us to \nwatch television, listen to the radio, read magazines. Yet mass entertainment is a means of escape and \nstress-reduction on which most of us have become dependent. Everyone complains about the trashiness of \ntelevision, but almost everyone watches it. A few have kicked the TV habit, but it would be a rare person \nwho could get along today without using ANY form of mass entertainment. (Yet until quite recently in \nhuman history most people got along very nicely with no other entertainment than that which each local \ncommunity created for itself.) Without the entertainment industry the system probably would not have been \nable to get away with putting as much stress-producing pressure on us as it does.<p>\n157. Assuming that industrial society survives, it is likely that technology will eventually acquire something \napproaching complete control over human behavior. It has been established beyond any rational doubt that \nhuman thought and behavior have a largely biological basis. As experimenters have demonstrated, feelings \nsuch as hunger, pleasure, anger and fear can be turned on and off by electrical stimulation of appropriate \nparts of the brain. Memories can be destroyed by damaging parts of the brain or they can be brought to the \nsurface by electrical stimulation. Hallucinations can be induced or moods changed by drugs. There may or \nmay not be an immaterial human soul, but if there is one it clearly is less powerful that the biological \nmechanisms of human behavior. For if that were not the case then researchers would not be able so easily to \nmanipulate human feelings and behavior with drugs and electrical currents.<p>\n158. It presumably would be impractical for all people to have electrodes inserted in their heads so that they \ncould be controlled by the authorities. But the fact that human thoughts and feelings are so open to \nbiological intervention shows that the problem of controlling human behavior is mainly a technical problem; \na problem of neurons, hormones and complex molecules; the kind of problem that is accessible to scientific \nattack. Given the outstanding record of our society in solving technical problems, it is overwhelmingly \nprobable that great advances will be made in the control of human behavior.<p>\n159. Will public resistance prevent the introduction of technological control of human behavior? It certainly \nwould if an attempt were made to introduce such control all at once. But since technological control will be \nintroduced through a long sequence of small advances, there will be no rational and effective public \nresistance. (See paragraphs 127, 132, 153.)<p>\n160. To those who think that all this sounds like science fiction, we point out that yesterday\u0092s science fiction \nis today\u0092s fact. The Industrial Revolution has radically altered man\u0092s environment and way of life, and it is \nonly to be expected that as technology is increasingly applied to the human body and mind, man himself \nwill be altered as radically as his environment and way of life have been.<p>\nHUMAN RACE AT A CROSSROADS<p>\n161. But we have gotten ahead of our story. It is one thing to develop in the laboratory a series of \npsychological or biological techniques for manipulating human behavior and quite another to integrate these \ntechniques into a functioning social system. The latter problem is the more difficult of the two. For example, \nwhile the techniques of educational psychology doubtless work quite well in the \u0093lab schools\u0094 where they \nare developed, it is not necessarily easy to apply them effectively throughout our educational system. We all \nknow what many of our schools are like. The teachers are too busy taking knives and guns away from the \nkids to subject them to the latest techniques for making them into computer nerds. Thus, in spite of all its \ntechnical advances relating to human behavior, the system to date has not been impressively successful in \ncontrolling human beings. The people whose behavior is fairly well under the control of the system are \nthose of the type that might be called \u0093bourgeois.\u0094 But there are growing numbers of people who in one way \nor another are rebels against the system: welfare leaches, youth gangs, cultists, satanists, nazis, radical \nenvironmentalists, militiamen, etc.<p>\n162. The system is currently engaged in a desperate struggle to overcome certain problems that threaten its \nsurvival, among which the problems of human behavior are the most important. If the system succeeds in \nacquiring sufficient control over human behavior quickly enough, it will probably survive. Otherwise it will \nbreak down. We think the issue will most likely be resolved within the next several decades, say 40 to 100 \nyears.<p>\n163. Suppose the system survives the crisis of the next several decades. By that time it will have to have \nsolved, or at least brought under control, the principal problems that confront it, in particular that of \n\u0093socializing\u0094 human beings; that is, making people sufficiently docile so that heir behavior no longer \nthreatens the system. That being accomplished, it does not appear that there would be any further obstacle \nto the development of technology, and it would presumably advance toward its logical conclusion, which is \ncomplete control over everything on Earth, including human beings and all other important organisms. The \nsystem may become a unitary, monolithic organization, or it may be more or less fragmented and consist of \na number of organizations coexisting in a relationship that includes elements of both cooperation and \ncompetition, just as today the government, the corporations and other large organizations both cooperate \nand compete with one another. Human freedom mostly will have vanished, because individuals and small \ngroups will be impotent vis-a-vis large organizations armed with supertechnology and an arsenal of \nadvanced psychological and biological tools for manipulating human beings, besides instruments of \nsurveillance and physical coercion. Only a small number of people will have any real power, and even these \nprobably will have only very limited freedom, because their behavior too will be regulated; just as today our \npoliticians and corporation executives can retain their positions of power only as long as their behavior \nremains within certain fairly narrow limits.<p>\n164. Don\u0092t imagine that the systems will stop developing further techniques for controlling human beings \nand nature once the crisis of the next few decades is over and increasing control is no longer necessary for \nthe system\u0092s survival. On the contrary, once the hard times are over the system will increase its control over \npeople and nature more rapidly, because it will no longer be hampered by difficulties of the kind that it is \ncurrently experiencing. Survival is not the principal motive for extending control. As we explained in \nparagraphs 87-90, technicians and scientists carry on their work largely as a surrogate activity; that is, they \nsatisfy their need for power by solving technical problems. They will continue to do this with unabated \nenthusiasm, and among the most interesting and challenging problems for them to solve will be those of \nunderstanding the human body and mind and intervening in their development. For the \u0093good of humanity,\u0094 \nof course.<p>\n165. But suppose on the other hand that the stresses of the coming decades prove to be too much for the \nsystem. If the system breaks down there may be a period of chaos, a \u0093time of troubles\u0094 such as those that \nhistory has recorded at various epochs in the past. It is impossible to predict what would emerge from such \na time of troubles, but at any rate the human race would be given a new chance. The greatest danger is that \nindustrial society may begin to reconstitute itself within the first few years after the breakdown. Certainly \nthere will be many people (power-hungry types especially) who will be anxious to get the factories running \nagain.<p>\n166. Therefore two tasks confront those who hate the servitude to which the industrial system is reducing \nthe human race. First, we must work to heighten the social stresses within the system so as to increase the \nlikelihood that it will break down or be weakened sufficiently so that a revolution against it becomes \npossible. Second, it is necessary to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the \nindustrial society if and when the system becomes sufficiently weakened. And such an ideology will help to \nassure that, if and when industrial society breaks down, its remnants will be smashed beyond repair, so that \nthe system cannot be reconstituted. The factories should be destroyed, technical books burned, etc.<p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<table width=\"580\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td width=\"20\"><IMG src=\"/wp-srv/images/common/clearspc.gif\" width=\"20\" height=\"1\">\n</td>\n<td>\nHUMAN SUFFERING<p>\n167. The industrial system will not break down purely as a result of revolutionary action. It will not be \nvulnerable to revolutionary attack unless its own internal problems of development lead it into very serious \ndifficulties. So if the system breaks down it will do so either spontaneously, or through a process that is in \npart spontaneous but helped along by revolutionaries. If the breakdown is sudden, many people will die, \nsince the world\u0092s population has become so overblown that it cannot even feed itself any longer without \nadvanced technology. Even if the breakdown is gradual enough so that reduction of the population can \noccur more through lowering of the birth rate than through elevation of the death rate, the process of de-\nindustrialization probably will be very chaotic and involve much suffering. It is naive to think it likely that \ntechnology can be phased out in a smoothly managed, orderly way, especially since the technophiles will \nfight stubbornly at every step. Is it therefore cruel to work for the breakdown of the system? Maybe, but \nmaybe not. In the first place, revolutionaries will not be able to break the system down unless it is already in \nenough trouble so that there would be a good chance of its eventually breaking down by itself anyway; and \nthe bigger the system grows, the more disastrous the consequences of its breakdown will be; so it may be \nthat revolutionaries, by hastening the onset of the breakdown, will be reducing the extent of the disaster.<p>\n168. In the second place, one has to balance struggle and death against the loss of freedom and dignity. To \nmany of us, freedom and dignity are more important than a long life or avoidance of physical pain. Besides, \nwe all have to die some time, and it may be better to die fighting for survival, or for a cause, than to live a \nlong but empty and purposeless life.<p>\n169. In the third place, it is not at all certain that survival of the system will lead to less suffering than \nbreakdown of the system would. The system has already caused, and is continuing to cause, immense \nsuffering all over the world. Ancient cultures, that for hundreds of years gave people a satisfactory \nrelationship with each other and with their environment, have been shattered by contact with industrial \nsociety, and the result has been a whole catalogue of economic, environmental, social and psychological \nproblems. One of the effects of the intrusion of industrial society has been that over much of the world \ntraditional controls on population have been thrown out of balance. Hence the population explosion, with \nall that that implies. Then there is the psychological suffering that is widespread throughout the supposedly \nfortunate countries of the West (see paragraphs 44, 45). No one knows what will happen as a result of ozone \ndepletion, the greenhouse effect and other environmental problems that cannot yet be foreseen. And, as \nnuclear proliferation has shown, new technology cannot be kept out of the hands of dictators and \nirresponsible Third World nations. Would you like to speculate about what Iraq or North Korea will do with \ngenetic engineering?<p>\n170. \u0093Oh!\u0094 say the technophiles, \u0093Science is going to fix all that! We will conquer famine, eliminate \npsychological suffering, make everybody healthy and happy!\u0094 Yeah, sure. That\u0092s what they said 200 years \nago. The Industrial Revolution was supposed to eliminate poverty, make everybody happy, etc. The actual \nresult has been quite different. The technophiles are hopelessly naive (or self-deceiving) in their \nunderstanding of social problems. They are unaware of (or choose to ignore) the fact that when large \nchanges, even seemingly beneficial ones, are introduced into a society, they lead to a long sequence of other \nchanges, most of which are impossible to predict (paragraph 103). The result is disruption of the society. So \nit is very probable that in their attempts to end poverty and disease, engineer docile, happy personalities and \nso forth, the technophiles will create social systems that are terribly troubled, even more so than the present \nonce. For example, the scientists boast that they will end famine by creating new, genetically engineered \nfood plants. But this will allow the human population to keep expanding indefinitely, and it is well known \nthat crowding leads to increased stress and aggression. This is merely one example of the PREDICTABLE \nproblems that will arise. We emphasize that, as past experience has shown, technical progress will lead to \nother new problems that CANNOT be predicted in advance (paragraph 103). In fact, ever since the \nIndustrial Revolution, technology has been creating new problems for society far more rapidly than it has \nbeen solving old ones. Thus it will take a long and difficult period of trial and error for the technophiles to \nwork the bugs out of their Brave New World (if they every do). In the meantime there will be great \nsuffering. So it is not at all clear that the survival of industrial society would involve less suffering than the \nbreakdown of that society would. Technology has gotten the human race into a fix from which there is not \nlikely to be any easy escape.<p>\nTHE FUTURE<p>\n171. But suppose now that industrial society does survive the next several decades and that the bugs do \neventually get worked out of the system, so that it functions smoothly. What kind of system will it be? We \nwill consider several possibilities.<p>\n172. First let us postulate that the computer scientists succeed in developing intelligent machines that can do \nall things better than human beings can do them. In that case presumably all work will be done by vast, \nhighly organized systems of machines and no human effort will be necessary. Either of two cases might \noccur. The machines might be permitted to make all of their own decisions without human oversight, or else \nhuman control over the machines might be retained.<p>\n173. If the machines are permitted to make all their own decisions, we can\u0092t make any conjectures as to the \nresults, because it is impossible to guess how such machines might behave. We only point out that the fate \nof the human race would be at the mercy of the machines. It might be argued that the human race would \nnever be foolish enough to hand over all power to the machines. But we are suggesting neither that the \nhuman race would voluntarily turn power over to the machines nor that the machines would willfully seize \npower. What we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to drift into a position of such \ndependence on the machines that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines\u0092 \ndecisions. As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and as machines \nbecome more and more intelligent, people will let machines make more and more of their decisions for \nthem, simply because machine-made decisions will bring better results than man-made ones. Eventually a \nstage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep the system running will be so complex that \nhuman beings will be incapable of making them intelligently. At that stage the machines will be in effective \ncontrol. People won\u0092t be able to just turn the machines off, because they will be so dependent on them that \nturning them off would amount to suicide.<p>\n174. On the other hand it is possible that human control over the machines may be retained. In that case the \naverage man may have control over certain private machines of his own, such as his car or his personal \ncomputer, but control over large systems of machines will be in the hands of a tiny elite\u0097just as it is today, \nbut with two differences. Due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses; \nand because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous, a useless burden on \nthe system. If the elite is ruthless they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity. If they are \nhumane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate \nuntil the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to the elite. Or, if the elite consists of soft-\nhearted liberals, they may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race. They will \nsee to it that everyone\u0092s physical needs are satisfied, that all children are raised under psychologically \nhygienic conditions, that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy, and that anyone who may \nbecome dissatisfied undergoes \u0093treatment\u0094 to cure his \u0093problem.\u0094 Of course, life will be so purposeless that \npeople will have to be biologically or psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power \nprocess or to make them \u0093sublimate\u0094 their drive for power into some harmless hobby. These engineered \nhuman beings may be happy in such a society, but they most certainly will not be free. They will have been \nreduced to the status of domestic animals.<p>\n175. But suppose now that the computer scientists do not succeed in developing artificial intelligence, so \nthat human work remains necessary. Even so, machines will take care of more and more of the simpler tasks \nso that there will be an increasing surplus of human workers at the lower levels of ability. (We see this \nhappening already. There are many people who find it difficult or impossible to get work, because for \nintellectual or psychological reasons they cannot acquire the level of training necessary to make themselves \nuseful in the present system.) On those who are employed, ever-increasing demands will be placed: They \nwill need more and more training, more and more ability, and will have to be ever more reliable, \nconforming and docile, because they will be more and more like cells of a giant organism. Their tasks will \nbe increasingly specialized, so that their work will be, in a sense, out of touch with the real world, being \nconcentrated on one tiny slice of reality. The system will have to use any means that it can, whether \npsychological or biological, to engineer people to be docile, to have the abilities that the system requires \nand to \u0093sublimate\u0094 their drive for power into some specialized task. But the statement that the people of \nsuch a society will have to be docile may require qualification. The society may find competitiveness useful, \nprovided that ways are found of directing competitiveness into channels that serve the needs of the system. \nWe can imagine a future society in which there is endless competition for positions of prestige and power. \nBut no more than a very few people will ever reach the top, where the only real power is (see end of \nparagraph 163). Very repellent is a society in which a person can satisfy his need for power only by pushing \nlarge numbers of other people out of the way and depriving them of THEIR opportunity for power.<p>\n176. One can envision scenarios that incorporate aspects of more than one of the possibilities that we have \njust discussed. For instance, it may be that machines will take over most of the work that is of real, practical \nimportance, but that human beings will be kept busy by being given relatively unimportant work. It has been \nsuggested, for example, that a great development of the service industries might provide work for human \nbeings. Thus people would spent their time shining each other\u0092s shoes, driving each other around in \ntaxicabs, making handicrafts for one another, waiting on each other\u0092s tables, etc. This seems to us a \nthoroughly contemptible way for the human race to end up, and we doubt that many people would find \nfulfilling lives in such pointless busy-work. They would seek other, dangerous outlets (drugs, crime, \u0093cults,\u0094 \nhate groups) unless they were biologically or psychologically engineered to adapt them to such a way of \nlife.<p>\n177. Needless to say, the scenarios outlined above do not exhaust all the possibilities. They only indicate \nthe kinds of outcomes that seem to us most likely. But we can envision no plausible scenarios that are any \nmore palatable than the ones we\u0092ve just described. It is overwhelmingly probable that if the industrial-\ntechnological system survives the next 40 to 100 years, it will by that time have developed certain general \ncharacteristics: Individuals (at least those of the \u0093bourgeois\u0094 type, who are integrated into the system and \nmake it run, and who therefore have all the power) will be more dependent than ever on large organizations; \nthey will be more \u0093socialized\u0094 than ever and their physical and mental qualities to a significant extent \n(possibly to a very great extent) will be those that are engineered into them rather than being the results of \nchance (or of God\u0092s will, or whatever); and whatever may be left of wild nature will be reduced to remnants \npreserved for scientific study and kept under the supervision and management of scientists (hence it will no \nlonger be truly wild). In the long run (say a few centuries from now) it is likely that neither the human race \nnor any other important organisms will exist as we know them today, because once you start modifying \norganisms through genetic engineering there is no reason to stop at any particular point, so that the \nmodifications will probably continue until man and other organisms have been utterly transformed.<p>\n178. Whatever else may be the case, it is certain that technology is creating for human beings a new \nphysical and social environment radically different from the spectrum of environments to which natural \nselection has adapted the human race physically and psychologically. If man is not adjusted to this new \nenvironment by being artificially re-engineered, then he will be adapted to it through a long and painful \nprocess of natural selection. The former is far more likely than the latter.<p>\n179. It would be better to dump the whole stinking system and take the consequences.<p>\nSTRATEGY<p>\n180. The technophiles are taking us all on an utterly reckless ride into the unknown. Many people \nunderstand something of what technological progress is doing to us yet take a passive attitude toward it \nbecause they think it is inevitable. But we (FC) don\u0092t think it is inevitable. We think it can be stopped, and \nwe will give here some indications of how to go about stopping it.<p>\n181. As we stated in paragraph 166, the two main tasks for the present are to promote social stress and \ninstability in industrial society and to develop and propagate an ideology that opposes technology and the \nindustrial system. When the system becomes sufficiently stressed and unstable, a revolution against \ntechnology may be possible. The pattern would be similar to that of the French and Russian Revolutions. \nFrench society and Russian society, for several decades prior to their respective revolutions, showed \nincreasing signs of stress and weakness. Meanwhile, ideologies were being developed that offered a new \nworld view that was quite different from the old one. In the Russian case, revolutionaries were actively \nworking to undermine the old order. Then, when the old system was put under sufficient additional stress \n(by financial crisis in France, by military defeat in Russia) it was swept away by revolution. What we \npropose is something along the same lines.<p>\n182. It will be objected that the French and Russian Revolutions were failures. But most revolutions have \ntwo goals. One is to destroy an old form of society and the other is to set up the new form of society \nenvisioned by the revolutionaries. The French and Russian revolutionaries failed (fortunately!) to create the \nnew kind of society of which they dreamed, but they were quite successful in destroying the old society. We \nhave no illusions about the feasibility of creating a new, ideal form of society. Our goal is only to destroy \nthe existing form of society.<p>\n183. But an ideology, in order to gain enthusiastic support, must have a positive ideal as well as a negative \none; it must be FOR something as well as AGAINST something. The positive ideal that we propose is \nNature. That is, WILD nature: those aspects of the functioning of the Earth and its living things that are \nindependent of human management and free of human interference and control. And with wild nature we \ninclude human nature, by which we mean those aspects of the functioning of the human individual that are \nnot subject to regulation by organized society but are products of chance, or free will, or God (depending on \nyour religious or philosophical opinions).<p>\n184. Nature makes a perfect counter-ideal to technology for several reasons. Nature (that which is outside \nthe power of the system) is the opposite of technology (which seeks to expand indefinitely the power of the \nsystem). Most people will agree that nature is beautiful; certainly it has tremendous popular appeal. The \nradical environmentalists ALREADY hold an ideology that exalts nature and opposes technology. [30] It is \nnot necessary for the sake of nature to set up some chimerical utopia or any new kind of social order. Nature \ntakes care of itself: It was a spontaneous creation that existed long before any human society, and for \ncountless centuries many different kinds of human societies coexisted with nature without doing it an \nexcessive amount of damage. Only with the Industrial Revolution did the effect of human society on nature \nbecome really devastating. To relieve the pressure on nature it is not necessary to create a special kind of \nsocial system, it is only necessary to get rid of industrial society. Granted, this will not solve all problems. \nIndustrial society has already done tremendous damage to nature and it will take a very long time for the \nscars to heal. Besides, even pre-industrial societies can do significant damage to nature. Nevertheless, \ngetting rid of industrial society will accomplish a great deal. It will relieve the worst of the pressure on \nnature so that the scars can begin to heal. It will remove the capacity of organized society to keep increasing \nits control over nature (including human nature). Whatever kind of society may exist after the demise of the \nindustrial system, it is certain that most people will live close to nature, because in the absence of advanced \ntechnology there is no other way that people CAN live. To feed themselves they must be peasants or \nherdsmen or fishermen or hunters, etc. And, generally speaking, local autonomy should tend to increase, \nbecause lack of advanced technology and rapid communications will limit the capacity of governments or \nother large organizations to control local communities.<p>\n185. As for the negative consequences of eliminating industrial society\u0097well, you can\u0092t eat your cake and \nhave it too. To gain one thing you have to sacrifice another.<p>\n186. Most people hate psychological conflict. For this reason they avoid doing any serious thinking about \ndifficult social issues, and they like to have such issues presented to them in simple, black-and-white terms: \nTHIS is all good and THAT is all bad. The revolutionary ideology should therefore be developed on two \nlevels.<p>\n187. On the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself to people who are intelligent, \nthoughtful and rational. The object should be to create a core of people who will be opposed to the \nindustrial system on a rational, thought-out basis, with full appreciation of the problems and ambiguities \ninvolved, and of the price that has to be paid for getting rid of the system. It is particularly important to \nattract people of this type, as they are capable people and will be instrumental in influencing others. These \npeople should be addressed on as rational a level as possible. Facts should never intentionally be distorted \nand intemperate language should be avoided. This does not mean that no appeal can be made to the \nemotions, but in making such appeal care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth or doing \nanything else that would destroy the intellectual respectability of the ideology.<p>\n188. On a second level, the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form that will enable the \nunthinking majority to see the conflict of technology vs. nature in unambiguous terms. But even on this \nsecond level the ideology should not be expressed in language that is so cheap, intemperate or irrational that \nit alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type. Cheap, intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves \nimpressive short-term gains, but it will be more advantageous in the long run to keep the loyalty of a small \nnumber of intelligently committed people than to arouse the passions of an unthinking, fickle mob who will \nchange their attitude as soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick. However, \npropaganda of the rabble-rousing type may be necessary when the system is nearing the point of collapse \nand there is a final struggle between rival ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old \nworld-view goes under.<p>\n189. Prior to that final struggle, the revolutionaries should not expect to have a majority of people on their \nside. History is made by active, determined minorities, not by the majority, which seldom has a clear and \nconsistent idea of what it really wants. Until the time comes for the final push toward revolution [31], the \ntask of revolutionaries will be less to win the shallow support of the majority than to build a small core of \ndeeply committed people. As for the majority, it will be enough to make them aware of the existence of the \nnew ideology and remind them of it frequently; though of course it will be desirable to get majority support \nto the extent that this can be done without weakening the core of seriously committed people.<p>\n190. Any kind of social conflict helps to destabilize the system, but one should be careful about what kind \nof conflict one encourages. The line of conflict should be drawn between the mass of the people and the \npower-holding elite of industrial society (politicians, scientists, upper-level business executives, government \nofficials, etc.). It should NOT be drawn between the revolutionaries and the mass of the people. For \nexample, it would be bad strategy for the revolutionaries to condemn Americans for their habits of \nconsumption. Instead, the average American should be portrayed as a victim of the advertising and \nmarketing industry, which has suckered him into buying a lot of junk that he doesn\u0092t need and that is very \npoor compensation for his lost freedom. Either approach is consistent with the facts. It is merely a matter of \nattitude whether you blame the advertising industry for manipulating the public or blame the public for \nallowing itself to be manipulated. As a matter of strategy one should generally avoid blaming the \npublic.<p>\n191. One should think twice before encouraging any other social conflict than that between the power-\nholding elite (which wields technology) and the general public (over which technology exerts its power). \nFor one thing, other conflicts tend to distract attention from the important conflicts (between power-elite \nand ordinary people, between technology and nature); for another thing, other conflicts may actually tend to \nencourage technologization, because each side in such a conflict wants to use technological power to gain \nadvantages over its adversary. This is clearly seen in rivalries between nations. It also appears in ethnic \nconflicts within nations. For example, in America many black leaders are anxious to gain power for African \nAmericans by placing back individuals in the technological power-elite. They want there to be many black \ngovernment officials, scientists, corporation executives and so forth. In this way they are helping to absorb \nthe African American subculture into the technological system. Generally speaking, one should encourage \nonly those social conflicts that can be fitted into the framework of the conflicts of power-elite vs. ordinary \npeople, technology vs nature.<p>\n192. But the way to discourage ethnic conflict is NOT through militant advocacy of minority rights (see \nparagraphs 21, 29). Instead, the revolutionaries should emphasize that although minorities do suffer more or \nless disadvantage, this disadvantage is of peripheral significance. Our real enemy is the industrial-\ntechnological system, and in the struggle against the system, ethnic distinctions are of no importance.<p>\n193. The kind of revolution we have in mind will not necessarily involve an armed uprising against any \ngovernment. It may or may not involve physical violence, but it will not be a POLITICAL revolution. Its \nfocus will be on technology and economics, not politics. [32]<p>\n194. Probably the revolutionaries should even AVOID assuming political power, whether by legal or illegal \nmeans, until the industrial system is stressed to the danger point and has proved itself to be a failure in the \neyes of most people. Suppose for example that some \u0093green\u0094 party should win control of the United States \nCongress in an election. In order to avoid betraying or watering down their own ideology they would have \nto take vigorous measures to turn economic growth into economic shrinkage. To the average man the results \nwould appear disastrous: There would be massive unemployment, shortages of commodities, etc. Even if \nthe grosser ill effects could be avoided through superhumanly skillful management, still people would have \nto begin giving up the luxuries to which they have become addicted. Dissatisfaction would grow, the \n\u0093green\u0094 party would be voted out of office and the revolutionaries would have suffered a severe setback. \nFor this reason the revolutionaries should not try to acquire political power until the system has gotten itself \ninto such a mess that any hardships will be seen as resulting from the failures of the industrial system itself \nand not from the policies of the revolutionaries. The revolution against technology will probably have to be \na revolution by outsiders, a revolution from below and not from above.<p>\n195. The revolution must be international and worldwide. It cannot be carried out on a nation-by-nation \nbasis. Whenever it is suggested that the United States, for example, should cut back on technological \nprogress or economic growth, people get hysterical and start screaming that if we fall behind in technology \nthe Japanese will get ahead of us. Holy robots! The world will fly off its orbit if the Japanese ever sell more \ncars than we do! (Nationalism is a great promoter of technology.) More reasonably, it is argued that if the \nrelatively democratic nations of the world fall behind in technology while nasty, dictatorial nations like \nChina, Vietnam and North Korea continue to progress, eventually the dictators may come to dominate the \nworld. That is why the industrial system should be attacked in all nations simultaneously, to the extent that \nthis may be possible. True, there is no assurance that the industrial system can be destroyed at \napproximately the same time all over the world, and it is even conceivable that the attempt to overthrow the \nsystem could lead instead to the domination of the system by dictators. That is a risk that has to be taken. \nAnd it is worth taking, since the difference between a \u0093democratic\u0094 industrial system and one controlled by \ndictators is small compared with the difference between an industrial system and a non-industrial one. [33] \nIt might even be argued that an industrial system controlled by dictators would be preferable, because \ndictator-controlled systems usually have proved inefficient, hence they are presumably more likely to break \ndown. Look at Cuba.<p>\n196. Revolutionaries might consider favoring measures that tend to bind the world economy into a unified \nwhole. Free trade agreements like NAFTA and GATT are probably harmful to the environment in the short \nrun, but in the long run they may perhaps be advantageous because they foster economic interdependence \nbetween nations. It will be easier to destroy the industrial system on a worldwide basis if the world economy \nis so unified that its breakdown in any one major nation will lead to its breakdown in all industrialized \nnations.<p>\n197. Some people take the line that modern man has too much power, too much control over nature; they \nargue for a more passive attitude on the part of the human race. At best these people are expressing \nthemselves unclearly, because they fail to distinguish between power for LARGE ORGANIZATIONS and \npower for INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS. It is a mistake to argue for powerlessness and passivity, \nbecause people NEED power. Modern man as a collective entity\u0097that is, the industrial system\u0097has \nimmense power over nature, and we (FC) regard this as evil. But modern INDIVIDUALS and SMALL \nGROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS have far less power than primitive man ever did. Generally speaking, the vast \npower of \u0093modern man\u0094 over nature is exercised not by individuals or small groups but by large \norganizations. To the extent that the average modern INDIVIDUAL can wield the power of technology, he \nis permitted to do so only within narrow limits and only under the supervision and control of the system. \n(You need a license for everything and with the license come rules and regulations.) The individual has only \nthose technological powers with which the system chooses to provide him. His PERSONAL power over \nnature is slight.<p>\n198. Primitive INDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS actually had considerable power over nature; or \nmaybe it would be better to say power WITHIN nature. When primitive man needed food he knew how to \nfind and prepare edible roots, how to track game and take it with homemade weapons. He knew how to \nprotect himself from heat, cold, rain, dangerous animals, etc. But primitive man did relatively little damage \nto nature because the COLLECTIVE power of primitive society was negligible compared to the \nCOLLECTIVE power of industrial society.<p>\n199. Instead of arguing for powerlessness and passivity, one should argue that the power of the \nINDUSTRIAL SYSTEM should be broken, and that this will greatly INCREASE the power and freedom of \nINDIVIDUALS and SMALL GROUPS.<p>\n200. Until the industrial system has been thoroughly wrecked, the destruction of that system must be the \nrevolutionaries\u0092 ONLY goal. Other goals would distract attention and energy from the main goal. More \nimportantly, if the revolutionaries permit themselves to have any other goal than the destruction of \ntechnology, they will be tempted to use technology as a tool for reaching that other goal. If they give in to \nthat temptation, they will fall right back into the technological trap, because modern technology is a unified, \ntightly organized system, so that, in order to retain SOME technology, one finds oneself obliged to retain \nMOST technology, hence one ends up sacrificing only token amounts of technology.<p>\n201. Suppose for example that the revolutionaries took \u0093social justice\u0094 as a goal. Human nature being what \nit is, social justice would not come about spontaneously; it would have to be enforced. In order to enforce it \nthe revolutionaries would have to retain central organization and control. For that they would need rapid \nlong-distance transportation and communication, and therefore all the technology needed to support the \ntransportation and communication systems. To feed and clothe poor people they would have to use \nagricultural and manufacturing technology. And so forth. So that the attempt to insure social justice would \nforce them to retain most parts of the technological system. Not that we have anything against social justice, \nbut it must not be allowed to interfere with the effort to get rid of the technological system.<p>\n202. It would be hopeless for revolutionaries to try to attack the system without using SOME modern \ntechnology. If nothing else they must use the communications media to spread their message. But they \nshould use modern technology for only ONE purpose: to attack the technological system.<p>\n203. Imagine an alcoholic sitting with a barrel of wine in front of him. Suppose he starts saying to himself, \n\u0093Wine isn\u0092t bad for you if used in moderation. Why, they say small amounts of wine are even good for you! \nIt won\u0092t do me any harm if I take just one little drink.... \u0093 Well you know what is going to happen. Never \nforget that the human race with technology is just like an alcoholic with a barrel of wine.<p>\n204. Revolutionaries should have as many children as they can. There is strong scientific evidence that \nsocial attitudes are to a significant extent inherited. No one suggests that a social attitude is a direct outcome \nof a person\u0092s genetic constitution, but it appears that personality traits are partly inherited and that certain \npersonality traits tend, within the context of our society, to make a person more likely to hold this or that \nsocial attitude. Objections to these findings have been raised, but the objections are feeble and seem to be \nideologically motivated. In any event, no one denies that children tend on the average to hold social \nattitudes similar to those of their parents. From our point of view it doesn\u0092t matter all that much whether the \nattitudes are passed on genetically or through childhood training. In either case they ARE passed on.<p>\n205. The trouble is that many of the people who are inclined to rebel against the industrial system are also \nconcerned about the population problems, hence they are apt to have few or no children. In this way they \nmay be handing the world over to the sort of people who support or at least accept the industrial system. To \ninsure the strength of the next generation of revolutionaries the present generation should reproduce itself \nabundantly. In doing so they will be worsening the population problem only slightly. And the important \nproblem is to get rid of the industrial system, because once the industrial system is gone the world\u0092s \npopulation necessarily will decrease (see paragraph 167); whereas, if the industrial system survives, it will \ncontinue developing new techniques of food production that may enable the world\u0092s population to keep \nincreasing almost indefinitely.<p>\n206. With regard to revolutionary strategy, the only points on which we absolutely insist are that the single \noverriding goal must be the elimination of modern technology, and that no other goal can be allowed to \ncompete with this one. For the rest, revolutionaries should take an empirical approach. If experience \nindicates that some of the recommendations made in the foregoing paragraphs are not going to give good \nresults, then those recommendations should be discarded.<p>\nTWO KINDS OF TECHNOLOGY<p>\n207. An argument likely to be raised against our proposed revolution is that it is bound to fail, because (it is \nclaimed) throughout history technology has always progressed, never regressed, hence technological \nregression is impossible. But this claim is false.<p>\n208. We distinguish between two kinds of technology, which we will call small-scale technology and \norganization-dependent technology. Small-scale technology is technology that can be used by small-scale \ncommunities without outside assistance. Organization-dependent technology is technology that depends on \nlarge-scale social organization. We are aware of no significant cases of regression in small-scale \ntechnology. But organization-dependent technology DOES regress when the social organization on which it \ndepends breaks down. Example: When the Roman Empire fell apart the Romans\u0092 small-scale technology \nsurvived because any clever village craftsman could build, for instance, a water wheel, any skilled smith \ncould make steel by Roman methods, and so forth. But the Romans\u0092 organization-dependent technology \nDID regress. Their aqueducts fell into disrepair and were never rebuilt. Their techniques of road \nconstruction were lost. The Roman system of urban sanitation was forgotten, so that not until rather recent \ntimes did the sanitation of European cities equal that of Ancient Rome.<p>\n209. The reason why technology has seemed always to progress is that, until perhaps a century or two \nbefore the Industrial Revolution, most technology was small-scale technology. But most of the technology \ndeveloped since the Industrial Revolution is organization-dependent technology. Take the refrigerator for \nexample. Without factory-made parts or the facilities of a post-industrial machine shop it would be virtually \nimpossible for a handful of local craftsmen to build a refrigerator. If by some miracle they did succeed in \nbuilding one it would be useless to them without a reliable source of electric power. So they would have to \ndam a stream and build a generator. Generators require large amounts of copper wire. Imagine trying to \nmake that wire without modern machinery. And where would they get a gas suitable for refrigeration? It \nwould be much easier to build an icehouse or preserve food by drying or picking, as was done before the \ninvention of the refrigerator.<p>\n210. So it is clear that if the industrial system were once thoroughly broken down, refrigeration technology \nwould quickly be lost. The same is true of other organization-dependent technology. And once this \ntechnology had been lost for a generation or so it would take centuries to rebuild it, just as it took centuries \nto build it the first time around. Surviving technical books would be few and scattered. An industrial \nsociety, if built from scratch without outside help, can only be built in a series of stages: You need tools to \nmake tools to make tools to make tools ... . A long process of economic development and progress in social \norganization is required. And, even in the absence of an ideology opposed to technology, there is no reason \nto believe that anyone would be interested in rebuilding industrial society. The enthusiasm for \u0093progress\u0094 is \na phenomenon peculiar to the modern form of society, and it seems not to have existed prior to the 17th \ncentury or thereabouts.<p>\n211. In the late Middle Ages there were four main civilizations that were about equally \u0093advanced\u0094: Europe, \nthe Islamic world, India, and the Far East (China, Japan, Korea). Three of those civilizations remained more \nor less stable, and only Europe became dynamic. No one knows why Europe became dynamic at that time; \nhistorians have their theories but these are only speculation. At any rate, it is clear that rapid development \ntoward a technological form of society occurs only under special conditions. So there is no reason to assume \nthat a long-lasting technological regression cannot be brought about.<p>\n212. Would society EVENTUALLY develop again toward an industrial-technological form? Maybe, but \nthere is no use in worrying about it, since we can\u0092t predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. \nThose problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time. <p>\nTHE DANGER OF LEFTISM<p>\n213. Because of their need for rebellion and for membership in a movement, leftists or persons of similar \npsychological type often are unattracted to a rebellious or activist movement whose goals and membership \nare not initially leftist. The resulting influx of leftish types can easily turn a non-leftist movement into a \nleftist one, so that leftist goals replace or distort the original goals of the movement.<p>\n214. To avoid this, a movement that exalts nature and opposes technology must take a resolutely anti-leftist \nstance and must avoid all collaboration with leftists. Leftism is in the long run inconsistent with wild nature, \nwith human freedom and with the elimination of modern technology. Leftism is collectivist; it seeks to bind \ntogether the entire world (both nature and the human race) into a unified whole. But this implies \nmanagement of nature and of human life by organized society, and it requires advanced technology. You \ncan\u0092t have a united world without rapid transportation and communication, you can\u0092t make all people love \none another without sophisticated psychological techniques, you can\u0092t have a \u0093planned society\u0094 without the \nnecessary technological base. Above all, leftism is driven by the need for power, and the leftist seeks power \non a collective basis, through identification with a mass movement or an organization. Leftism is unlikely \never to give up technology, because technology is too valuable a source of collective power.<p>\n215. The anarchist [34] too seeks power, but he seeks it on an individual or small-group basis; he wants \nindividuals and small groups to be able to control the circumstances of their own lives. He opposes \ntechnology because it makes small groups dependent on large organizations.<p>\n216. Some leftists may seem to oppose technology, but they will oppose it only so long as they are outsiders \nand the technological system is controlled by non-leftists. If leftism ever becomes dominant in society, so \nthat the technological system becomes a tool in the hands of leftists, they will enthusiastically use it and \npromote its growth. In doing this they will be repeating a pattern that leftism has shown again and again in \nthe past. When the Bolsheviks in Russia were outsiders, they vigorously opposed censorship and the secret \npolice, they advocated self-determination for ethnic minorities, and so forth; but as soon as they came into \npower themselves, they imposed a tighter censorship and created a more ruthless secret police than any that \nhad existed under the tsars, and they oppressed ethnic minorities at least as much as the tsars had done. In \nthe United States, a couple of decades ago when leftists were a minority in our universities, leftist professors \nwere vigorous proponents of academic freedom, but today, in those of our universities where leftists have \nbecome dominant, they have shown themselves ready to take away from everyone else\u0092s academic freedom. \n(This is \u0093political correctness.\u0094) The same will happen with leftists and technology: They will use it to \noppress everyone else if they ever get it under their own control.<p>\n217. In earlier revolutions, leftists of the most power-hungry type, repeatedly, have first cooperated with \nnon-leftist revolutionaries, as well as with leftists of a more libertarian inclination, and later have double-\ncrossed them to seize power for themselves. Robespierre did this in the French Revolution, the Bolsheviks \ndid it in the Russian Revolution, the communists did it in Spain in 1938 and Castro and his followers did it \nin Cuba. Given the past history of leftism, it would be utterly foolish for non-leftist revolutionaries today to \ncollaborate with leftists.<p>\n218. Various thinkers have pointed out that leftism is a kind of religion. Leftism is not a religion in the strict \nsense because leftist doctrine does not postulate the existence of any supernatural being. But, for the leftist, \nleftism plays a psychological role much like that which religion plays for some people. The leftist NEEDS \nto believe in leftism; it plays a vital role in his psychological economy. His beliefs are not easily modified \nby logic or facts. He has a deep conviction that leftism is morally Right with a capital R, and that he has not \nonly a right but a duty to impose leftist morality on everyone. (However, many of the people we are \nreferring to as \u0093leftists\u0094 do not think of themselves as leftists and would not describe their system of beliefs \nas leftism. We use the term \u0093leftism\u0094 because we don\u0092t know of any better words to designate the spectrum \nof related creeds that includes the feminist, gay rights, political correctness, etc., movements, and because \nthese movements have a strong affinity with the old left. See paragraphs 227-230.)<p>\n219. Leftism is a totalitarian force. Wherever leftism is in a position of power it tends to invade every \nprivate corner and force every thought into a leftist mold. In part this is because of the quasi-religious \ncharacter of leftism; everything contrary to leftist beliefs represents Sin. More importantly, leftism is a \ntotalitarian force because of the leftists\u0092 drive for power. The leftist seeks to satisfy his need for power \nthrough identification with a social movement and he tries to go through the power process by helping to \npursue and attain the goals of the movement (see paragraph 83). But no matter how far the movement has \ngone in attaining its goals the leftist is never satisfied, because his activism is a surrogate activity (see \nparagraph 41). That is, the leftist\u0092s real motive is not to attain the ostensible goals of leftism; in reality he is \nmotivated by the sense of power he gets from struggling for and then reaching a social goal. [35] \nConsequently the leftist is never satisfied with the goals he has already attained; his need for the power \nprocess leads him always to pursue some new goal. The leftist wants equal opportunities for minorities. \nWhen that is attained he insists on statistical equality of achievement by minorities. And as long as anyone \nharbors in some corner of his mind a negative attitude toward some minority, the leftist has to re-educated \nhim. And ethnic minorities are not enough; no one can be allowed to have a negative attitude toward \nhomosexuals, disabled people, fat people, old people, ugly people, and on and on and on. It\u0092s not enough \nthat the public should be informed about the hazards of smoking; a warning has to be stamped on every \npackage of cigarettes. Then cigarette advertising has to be restricted if not banned. The activists will never \nbe satisfied until tobacco is outlawed, and after that it will be alcohol, then junk food, etc. Activists have \nfought gross child abuse, which is reasonable. But now they want to stop all spanking. When they have done \nthat they will want to ban something else they consider unwholesome, then another thing and then another. \nThey will never be satisfied until they have complete control over all child rearing practices. And then they \nwill move on to another cause.<p>\n220. Suppose you asked leftists to make a list of ALL the things that were wrong with society, and then \nsuppose you instituted EVERY social change that they demanded. It is safe to say that within a couple of \nyears the majority of leftists would find something new to complain about, some new social \u0093evil\u0094 to correct \nbecause, once again, the leftist is motivated less by distress at society\u0092s ills than by the need to satisfy his \ndrive for power by imposing his solutions on society.<p>\n221. Because of the restrictions placed on their thoughts and behavior by their high level of socialization, \nmany leftists of the over-socialized type cannot pursue power in the ways that other people do. For them the \ndrive for power has only one morally acceptable outlet, and that is in the struggle to impose their morality \non everyone.<p>\n222. Leftists, especially those of the oversocialized type, are True Believers in the sense of Eric Hoffer\u0092s \nbook, \u0093The True Believer.\u0094 But not all True Believers are of the same psychological type as leftists. \nPresumably a true-believing nazi, for instance, is very different psychologically from a true-believing leftist. \nBecause of their capacity for single-minded devotion to a cause, True Believers are a useful, perhaps a \nnecessary, ingredient of any revolutionary movement. This presents a problem with which we must admit \nwe don\u0092t know how to deal. We aren\u0092t sure how to harness the energies of the True Believer to a revolution \nagainst technology. At present all we can say is that no True Believer will make a safe recruit to the \nrevolution unless his commitment is exclusively to the destruction of technology. If he is committed also to \nanother ideal, he may want to use technology as a tool for pursuing that other ideal (see paragraphs 220, \n221).<p>\n223. Some readers may say, \u0093This stuff about leftism is a lot of crap. I know John and Jane who are leftish \ntypes and they don\u0092t have all these totalitarian tendencies.\u0094 It\u0092s quite true that many leftists, possibly even a \nnumerical majority, are decent people who sincerely believe in tolerating others\u0092 values (up to a point) and \nwouldn\u0092t want to use high-handed methods to reach their social goals. Our remarks about leftism are not \nmeant to apply to every individual leftist but to describe the general character of leftism as a movement. \nAnd the general character of a movement is not necessarily determined by the numerical proportions of the \nvarious kinds of people involved in the movement.<p>\n224. The people who rise to positions of power in leftist movements tend to be leftists of the most power-\nhungry type, because power-hungry people are those who strive hardest to get into positions of power. Once \nthe power-hungry types have captured control of the movement, there are many leftists of a gentler breed \nwho inwardly disapprove of many of the actions of the leaders, but cannot bring themselves to oppose them. \nThey NEED their faith in the movement, and because they cannot give up this faith they go along with the \nleaders. True, SOME leftists do have the guts to oppose the totalitarian tendencies that emerge, but they \ngenerally lose, because the power-hungry types are better organized, are more ruthless and Machiavellian \nand have taken care to build themselves a strong power base. <p>\n225. These phenomena appeared clearly in Russia and other countries that were taken over by leftists. \nSimilarly, before the breakdown of communism in the USSR, leftish types in the West would seldom \ncriticize that country. If prodded they would admit that the USSR did many wrong things, but then they \nwould try to find excuses for the communists and begin talking about the faults of the West. They always \nopposed Western military resistance to communist aggression. Leftish types all over the world vigorously \nprotested the U.S. military action in Vietnam, but when the USSR invaded Afghanistan they did nothing. \nNot that they approved of the Soviet actions; but because of their leftist faith, they just couldn\u0092t bear to put \nthemselves in opposition to communism. Today, in those of our universities where \u0093political correctness\u0094 \nhas become dominant, there are probably many leftish types who privately disapprove of the suppression of \nacademic freedom, but they go along with it anyway.<p>\n226. Thus the fact that many individual leftists are personally mild and fairly tolerant people by no means \nprevents leftism as a whole form having a totalitarian tendency.<p>\n227. Our discussion of leftism has a serious weakness. It is still far from clear what we mean by the word \n\u0093leftist.\u0094 There doesn\u0092t seem to be much we can do about this. Today leftism is fragmented into a whole \nspectrum of activist movements. Yet not all activist movements are leftist, and some activist movements \n(e.g., radical environmentalism) seem to include both personalities of the leftist type and personalities of \nthoroughly un-leftist types who ought to know better than to collaborate with leftists. Varieties of leftists \nfade out gradually into varieties of non-leftists and we ourselves would often be hard-pressed to decide \nwhether a given individual is or is not a leftist. To the extent that it is defined at all, our conception of \nleftism is defined by the discussion of it that we have given in this article, and we can only advise the reader \nto use his own judgment in deciding who is a leftist.<p>\n228. But it will be helpful to list some criteria for diagnosing leftism. These criteria cannot be applied in a \ncut and dried manner. Some individuals may meet some of the criteria without being leftists, some leftists \nmay not meet any of the criteria. Again, you just have to use your judgment.<p>\n229. The leftist is oriented toward large-scale collectivism. He emphasizes the duty of the individual to \nserve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual. He has a negative attitude toward \nindividualism. He often takes a moralistic tone. He tends to be for gun control, for sex education and other \npsychologically \u0093enlightened\u0094 educational methods, for social planning, for affirmative action, for \nmulticulturalism. He tends to identify with victims. He tends to be against competition and against violence, \nbut he often finds excuses for those leftists who do commit violence. He is fond of using the common catch-\nphrases of the left, like \u0093racism,\u0094 \u0093sexism,\u0094 \u0093homophobia,\u0094 \u0093capitalism,\u0094 \u0093imperialism,\u0094 \u0093neocolonialism,\u0094 \n\u0093genocide,\u0094 \u0093social change,\u0094 \u0093social justice,\u0094 \u0093social responsibility.\u0094 Maybe the best diagnostic trait of the \nleftist is his tendency to sympathize with the following movements: feminism, gay rights, ethnic rights, \ndisability rights, animal rights, political correctness. Anyone who strongly sympathizes with ALL of these \nmovements is almost certainly a leftist. [36]<p>\n230. The more dangerous leftists, that is, those who are most power-hungry, are often characterized by \narrogance or by a dogmatic approach to ideology. However, the most dangerous leftists of all may be \ncertain oversocialized types who avoid irritating displays of aggressiveness and refrain from advertising \ntheir leftism, but work quietly and unobtrusively to promote collectivist values, \u0093enlightened\u0094 psychological \ntechniques for socializing children, dependence of the individual on the system, and so forth. These crypto-\nleftists (as we may call them) approximate certain bourgeois types as far as practical action is concerned, \nbut differ from them in psychology, ideology and motivation. The ordinary bourgeois tries to bring people \nunder control of the system in order to protect his way of life, or he does so simply because his attitudes are \nconventional. The crypto-leftist tries to bring people under control of the system because he is a True \nBeliever in a collectivistic ideology. The crypto-leftist is differentiated from the average leftist of the \noversocialized type by the fact that his rebellious impulse is weaker and he is more securely socialized. He \nis differentiated from the ordinary well-socialized bourgeois by the fact that there is some deep lack within \nhim that makes it necessary for him to devote himself to a cause and immerse himself in a collectivity. And \nmaybe his (well-sublimated) drive for power is stronger than that of the average bourgeois.<p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<table width=\"580\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tr>\n<td width=\"20\"><IMG src=\"/wp-srv/images/common/clearspc.gif\" width=\"20\" height=\"1\">\n</td>\n<td>\nFINAL NOTE<p>\n231. Throughout this article we\u0092ve made imprecise statements and statements that ought to have had all \nsorts of qualifications and reservations attached to them; and some of our statements may be flatly false. \nLack of sufficient information and the need for brevity made it impossible for us to formulate our assertions \nmore precisely or add all the necessary qualifications. And of course in a discussion of this kind one must \nrely heavily on intuitive judgment, and that can sometimes be wrong. So we don\u0092t claim that this article \nexpresses more than a crude approximation to the truth.<p>\n232. All the same, we are reasonably confident that the general outlines of the picture we have painted here \nare roughly correct. Just one possible weak point needs to be mentioned. We have portrayed leftism in its \nmodern form as a phenomenon peculiar to our time and as a symptom of the disruption of the power \nprocess. But we might possibly be wrong about this. Oversocialized types who try to satisfy their drive for \npower by imposing their morality on everyone have certainly been around for a long time. But we THINK \nthat the decisive role played by feelings of inferiority, low self-esteem, powerlessness, identification with \nvictims by people who are not themselves victims, is a peculiarity of modern leftism. Identification with \nvictims by people not themselves victims can be seen to some extent in 19th century leftism and early \nChristianity but as far as we can make out, symptoms of low self-esteem, etc., were not nearly so evident in \nthese movements, or in any other movements, as they are in modern leftism. But we are not in a position to \nassert confidently that no such movements have existed prior to modern leftism. This is a significant \nquestion to which historians ought to give their attention.<p>\nNotes<p>\n<font size=\"-1\">1. (Paragraph 19) We are asserting that ALL, or even most, bullies and ruthless competitors \nsuffer from feelings of inferiority.<p>\n2. (Paragraph 25) During the Victorian period many oversocialized people suffered from serious \npsychological problems as a result of repressing or trying to repress their sexual feelings. Freud apparently \nbased his theories on people of this type. Today the focus of socialization has shifted from sex to \naggression.<p>\n3. (Paragraph 27) Not necessarily including specialists in engineering or the \u0093hard\u0094 sciences.<p>\n4. (Paragraph 28) There are many individuals of the middle and upper classes who resist some of these \nvalues, but usually their resistance is more or less covert. Such resistance appears in the mass media only to \na very limited extent. The main thrust of propaganda in our society is in favor of the stated values.<p>\nThe main reason why these values have become, so to speak, the official values of our society is that they \nare useful to the industrial system. Violence is discouraged because it disrupts the functioning of the system. \nRacism is discouraged because ethnic conflicts also disrupt the system, and discrimination wastes the talents \nof minority-group members who could be useful to the system. Poverty must be \u0093cured\u0094 because the \nunderclass causes problems for the system and contact with the underclass lowers the morale of the other \nclasses. Women are encouraged to have careers because their talents are useful to the system and, more \nimportantly, because by having regular jobs women become better integrated into the system and tied \ndirectly to it rather than to their families. This helps to weaken family solidarity. (The leaders of the system \nsay they want to strengthen the family, but they really mean is that they want the family to serve as an \neffective tool for socializing children in accord with the needs of the system. We argue in paragraphs 51, 52 \nthat the system cannot afford to let the family or other small-scale social groups be strong or \nautonomous.)<p>\n5. (Paragraph 42) It may be argued that the majority of people don\u0092t want to make their own decisions but \nwant leaders to do their thinking for them. There is an element of truth in this. People like to make their own \ndecisions in small matters, but making decisions on difficult, fundamental questions requires facing up to \npsychological conflict, and most people hate psychological conflict. Hence they tend to lean on others in \nmaking difficult decisions. But it does not follow that they like to have decisions imposed upon them \nwithout having any opportunity to influence those decisions. The majority of people are natural followers, \nnot leaders, but they like to have direct personal access to their leaders, they want to be able to influence the \nleaders and participate to some extent in making even the difficult decisions. At least to that degree they \nneed autonomy.<p>\n6. (Paragraph 44) Some of the symptoms listed are similar to those shown by caged animals.<p>\nTo explain how these symptoms arise from deprivation with respect to the power process:<p>\nCommon-sense understanding of human nature tells one that lack of goals whose attainment requires effort \nleads to boredom and that boredom, long continued, often leads eventually to depression. Failure to attain \ngoals leads to frustration and lowering of self-esteem. Frustration leads to anger, anger to aggression, often \nin the form of spouse or child abuse. It has been shown that long-continued frustration commonly leads to \ndepression and that depression tends to cause guilt, sleep disorders, eating disorders and bad feelings about \noneself. Those who are tending toward depression seek pleasure as an antidote; hence insatiable hedonism \nand excessive sex, with perversions as a means of getting new kicks. Boredom too tends to cause excessive \npleasure-seeking since, lacking other goals, people often use pleasure as a goal. See accompanying \ndiagram.<p>\nThe foregoing is a simplification. Reality is more complex, and of course, deprivation with respect to the \npower process is not the ONLY cause of the symptoms described.<p>\nBy the way, when we mention depression we do not necessarily mean depression that is severe enough to be \ntreated by a psychiatrist. Often only mild forms of depression are involved. And when we speak of goals we \ndo not necessarily mean long-term, thought-out goals. For many or most people through much of human \nhistory, the goals of a hand-to-mouth existence (merely providing oneself and one\u0092s family with food from \nday to day) have been quite sufficient.<p>\n7. (Paragraph 52) A partial exception may be made for a few passive, inward-looking groups, such as the \nAmish, which have little effect on the wider society. Apart from these, some genuine small-scale \ncommunities do exist in America today. For instance, youth gangs and \u0093cults.\u0094 Everyone regards them as \ndangerous, and so they are, because the members of these groups are loyal primarily to one another rather \nthan to the system, hence the system cannot control them.<p>\nOr take the gypsies. The gypsies commonly get away with theft and fraud because their loyalties are such \nthat they can always get other gypsies to give testimony that \u0093proves\u0094 their innocence. Obviously the system \nwould be in serious trouble if too many people belonged to such groups.<p>\nSome of the early-20th century Chinese thinkers who were concerned with modernizing China recognized \nthe necessity breaking down small-scale social groups such as the family: \u0093(According to Sun Yat-sen) the \nChinese people needed a new surge of patriotism, which would lead to a transfer of loyalty from the family \nto the state.... (According to Li Huang) traditional attachments, particularly to the family had to be \nabandoned if nationalism were to develop in China.\u0094 (Chester C. Tan, \u0093Chinese Political Thought in the \nTwentieth Century,\u0094 page 125, page 297.)<p>\n8. (Paragraph 56) Yes, we know that 19th century America had its problems, and serious ones, but for the \nsake of brevity we have to express ourselves in simplified terms.<p>\n9. (Paragraph 61) We leave aside the \u0093underclass.\u0094 We are speaking of the mainstream.<p>\n10. (Paragraph 62) Some social scientists, educators, \u0093mental health\u0094 professionals and the like are doing \ntheir best to push the social drives into group 1 by trying to see to it that everyone has a satisfactory social \nlife.<p>\n11. (Paragraphs 63, 82) Is the drive for endless material acquisition really an artificial creation of the \nadvertising and marketing industry? Certainly there is no innate human drive for material acquisition. There \nhave been many cultures in which people have desired little material wealth beyond what was necessary to \nsatisfy their basic physical needs (Australian aborigines, traditional Mexican peasant culture, some African \ncultures). On the other hand there have also been many pre-industrial cultures in which material acquisition \nhas played an important role. So we can\u0092t claim that today\u0092s acquisition-oriented culture is exclusively a \ncreation of the advertising and marketing industry. But it is clear that the advertising and marketing industry \nhas had an important part in creating that culture. The big corporations that spend millions on advertising \nwouldn\u0092t be spending that kind of money without solid proof that they were getting it back in increased \nsales. One member of FC met a sales manager a couple of years ago who was frank enough to tell him, \u0093Our \njob is to make people buy things they don\u0092t want and don\u0092t need.\u0094 He then described how an untrained \nnovice could present people with the facts about a product, and make no sales at all, while a trained and \nexperienced professional salesman would make lots of sales to the same people. This shows that people are \nmanipulated into buying things they don\u0092t really want.<p>\n12. (Paragraph 64) The problem of purposelessness seems to have become less serious during the last 15 \nyears or so, because people now feel less secure physically and economically than they did earlier, and the \nneed for security provides them with a goal. But purposelessness has been replaced by frustration over the \ndifficulty of attaining security. We emphasize the problem of purposelessness because the liberals and \nleftists would wish to solve our social problems by having society guarantee everyone\u0092s security; but if that \ncould be done it would only bring back the problem of purposelessness. The real issue is not whether \nsociety provides well or poorly for people\u0092s security; the trouble is that people are dependent on the system \nfor their security rather than having it in their own hands. This, by the way, is part of the reason why some \npeople get worked up about the right to bear arms; possession of a gun puts that aspect of their security in \ntheir own hands.<p>\n13. (Paragraph 66) Conservatives\u0092 efforts to decrease the amount of government regulation are of little \nbenefit to the average man. For one thing, only a fraction of the regulations can be eliminated because most \nregulations are necessary. For another thing, most of the deregulation affects business rather than the \naverage individual, so that its main effect is to take power from the government and give it to private \ncorporations. What this means for the average man is that government interference in his life is replaced by \ninterference from big corporations, which may be permitted, for example, to dump more chemicals that get \ninto his water supply and give him cancer. The conservatives are just taking the average man for a sucker, \nexploiting his resentment of Big Government to promote the power of Big Business.<p>\n14. (Paragraph 73) When someone approves of the purpose for which propaganda is being used in a given \ncase, he generally calls it \u0093education\u0094 or applies to it some similar euphemism. But propaganda is \npropaganda regardless of the purpose for which it is used.<p>\n15. (Paragraph 83) We are not expressing approval or disapproval of the Panama invasion. We only use it \nto illustrate a point.<p>\n16. (Paragraph 95) When the American colonies were under British rule there were fewer and less effective \nlegal guarantees of freedom than there were after the American Constitution went into effect, yet there was \nmore personal freedom in pre-industrial America, both before and after the War of Independence, than there \nwas after the Industrial Revolution took hold in this country. We quote from \u0093Violence in America: \nHistorical and Comparative Perspectives,\u0094 edited by Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, Chapter 12 \nby Roger Lane, pages 476-478:<p>\n\u0093The progressive heightening of standards of propriety, and with it the increasing reliance on official law \nenforcement (in 19th century America) ... were common to the whole society.... [T]he change in social \nbehavior is so long term and so widespread as to suggest a connection with the most fundamental of \ncontemporary social processes; that of industrial urbanization itself....\u0094Massachusetts in 1835 had a \npopulation of some 660,940, 81 percent rural, overwhelmingly preindustrial and native born. It\u0092s citizens \nwere used to considerable personal freedom. Whether teamsters, farmers or artisans, they were all \naccustomed to setting their own schedules, and the nature of their work made them physically independent \nof each other.... Individual problems, sins or even crimes, were not generally cause for wider social \nconcern....\u0094But the impact of the twin movements to the city and to the factory, both just gathering force in \n1835, had a progressive effect on personal behavior throughout the 19th century and into the 20th. The \nfactory demanded regularity of behavior, a life governed by obedience to the rhythms of clock and calendar, \nthe demands of foreman and supervisor. In the city or town, the needs of living in closely packed \nneighborhoods inhibited many actions previously unobjectionable. Both blue- and white-collar employees \nin larger establishments were mutually dependent on their fellows; as one man\u0092s work fit into anther\u0092s, so \none man\u0092s business was no longer his own.<p>\n\u0093The results of the new organization of life and work were apparent by 1900, when some 76 percent of the \n2,805,346 inhabitants of Massachusetts were classified as urbanites. Much violent or irregular behavior \nwhich had been tolerable in a casual, independent society was no longer acceptable in the more formalized, \ncooperative atmosphere of the later period.... The move to the cities had, in short, produced a more \ntractable, more socialized, more \u0091civilized\u0092 generation than its predecessors.\u0094<p>\n17. (Paragraph 117) Apologists for the system are fond of citing cases in which elections have been decided \nby one or two votes, but such cases are rare.<p>\n18. (Paragraph 119) \u0093Today, in technologically advanced lands, men live very similar lives in spite of \ngeographical, religious, and political differences. The daily lives of a Christian bank clerk in Chicago, a \nBuddhist bank clerk in Tokyo, and a Communist bank clerk in Moscow are far more alike than the life of \nany one of them is like that of any single man who lived a thousand years ago. These similarities are the \nresult of a common technology....\u0094 L. Sprague de Camp, \u0093The Ancient Engineers,\u0094 Ballantine edition, page \n17.<p>\nThe lives of the three bank clerks are not IDENTICAL. Ideology does have SOME effect. But all \ntechnological societies, in order to survive, must evolve along APPROXIMATELY the same trajectory.<p>\n19. (Paragraph 123) Just think an irresponsible genetic engineer might create a lot of terrorists.<p>\n20. (Paragraph 124) For a further example of undesirable consequences of medical progress, suppose a \nreliable cure for cancer is discovered. Even if the treatment is too expensive to be available to any but the \nelite, it will greatly reduce their incentive to stop the escape of carcinogens into the environment.<p>\n21. (Paragraph 128) Since many people may find paradoxical the notion that a large number of good things \ncan add up to a bad thing, we illustrate with an analogy. Suppose Mr. A is playing chess with Mr. B. Mr. C, \na Grand Master, is looking over Mr. A\u0092s shoulder. Mr. A of course wants to win his game, so if Mr. C \npoints out a good move for him to make, he is doing Mr. A a favor. But suppose now that Mr. C tells Mr. A \nhow to make ALL of his moves. In each particular instance he does Mr. A a favor by showing him his best \nmove, but by making ALL of his moves for him he spoils his game, since there is not point in Mr. A\u0092s \nplaying the game at all if someone else makes all his moves.<p>\nThe situation of modern man is analogous to that of Mr. A. The system makes an individual\u0092s life easier for \nhim in innumerable ways, but in doing so it deprives him of control over his own fate.<p>\n22. (Paragraph 137) Here we are considering only the conflict of values within the mainstream. For the sake \nof simplicity we leave out of the picture \u0093outsider\u0094 values like the idea that wild nature is more important \nthan human economic welfare.<p>\n23. (Paragraph 137) Self-interest is not necessarily MATERIAL self-interest. It can consist in fulfillment of \nsome psychological need, for example, by promoting one\u0092s own ideology or religion.<p>\n24. (Paragraph 139) A qualification: It is in the interest of the system to permit a certain prescribed degree \nof freedom in some areas. For example, economic freedom (with suitable limitations and restraints) has \nproved effective in promoting economic growth. But only planned, circumscribed, limited freedom is in the \ninterest of the system. The individual must always be kept on a leash, even if the leash is sometimes long \n(see paragraphs 94, 97).<p>\n25. (Paragraph 143) We don\u0092t mean to suggest that the efficiency or the potential for survival of a society \nhas always been inversely proportional to the amount of pressure or discomfort to which the society \nsubjects people. That certainly is not the case. There is good reason to believe that many primitive societies \nsubjected people to less pressure than European society did, but European society proved far more efficient \nthan any primitive society and always won out in conflicts with such societies because of the advantages \nconferred by technology.<p>\n26. (Paragraph 147) If you think that more effective law enforcement is unequivocally good because it \nsuppresses crime, then remember that crime as defined by the system is not necessarily what YOU would \ncall crime. Today, smoking marijuana is a \u0093crime,\u0094 and, in some places in the U.S., so is possession of an \nunregistered handgun. Tomorrow, possession of ANY firearm, registered or not, may be made a crime, and \nthe same thing may happen with disapproved methods of child-rearing, such as spanking. In some countries, \nexpression of dissident political opinions is a crime, and there is no certainty that this will never happen in \nthe U.S., since no constitution or political system lasts forever.<p>\nIf a society needs a large, powerful law enforcement establishment, then there is something gravely wrong \nwith that society; it must be subjecting people to severe pressures if so many refuse to follow the rules, or \nfollow them only because forced. Many societies in the past have gotten by with little or no formal law-\nenforcement.<p>\n27. (Paragraph 151) To be sure, past societies have had means of influencing human behavior, but these \nhave been primitive and of low effectiveness compared with the technological means that are now being \ndeveloped.<p>\n28. (Paragraph 152) However, some psychologists have publicly expressed opinions indicating their \ncontempt for human freedom. And the mathematician Claude Shannon was quoted in Omni (August 1987) \nas saying, \u0093I visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I\u0092m rooting for the \nmachines.\u0094<p>\n29. (Paragraph 154) This is no science fiction! After writing paragraph 154 we came across an article in \nScientific American according to which scientists are actively developing techniques for identifying \npossible future criminals and for treating them by a combination of biological and psychological means. \nSome scientists advocate compulsory application of the treatment, which may be available in the near \nfuture. (See \u0093Seeking the Criminal Element,\u0094 by W. Wayt Gibbs, Scientific American, March 1995.) Maybe \nyou think this is OK because the treatment would be applied to those who might become violent criminals. \nBut of course it won\u0092t stop there. Next, a treatment will be applied to those who might become drunk \ndrivers (they endanger human life too), then perhaps to peel who spank their children, then to \nenvironmentalists who sabotage logging equipment, eventually to anyone whose behavior is inconvenient \nfor the system.<p>\n30. (Paragraph 184) A further advantage of nature as a counter-ideal to technology is that, in many people, \nnature inspires the kind of reverence that is associated with religion, so that nature could perhaps be \nidealized on a religious basis. It is true that in many societies religion has served as a support and \njustification for the established order, but it is also true that religion has often provided a basis for rebellion. \nThus it may be useful to introduce a religious element into the rebellion against technology, the more so \nbecause Western society today has no strong religious foundation. Religion, nowadays either is used as \ncheap and transparent support for narrow, short-sighted selfishness (some conservatives use it this way), or \neven is cynically exploited to make easy money (by many evangelists), or has degenerated into crude \nirrationalism (fundamentalist protestant sects, \u0093cults\u0094), or is simply stagnant (Catholicism, main-line \nProtestantism). The nearest thing to a strong, widespread, dynamic religion that the West has seen in recent \ntimes has been the quasi-religion of leftism, but leftism today is fragmented and has no clear, unified, \ninspiring goal.<p>\nThus there is a religious vacuum in our society that could perhaps be filled by a religion focused on nature \nin opposition to technology. But it would be a mistake to try to concoct artificially a religion to fill this role. \nSuch an invented religion would probably be a failure. Take the \u0093Gaia\u0094 religion for example. Do its \nadherents REALLY believe in it or are they just play-acting? If they are just play-acting their religion will \nbe a flop in the end.<p>\nIt is probably best not to try to introduce religion into the conflict of nature vs. technology unless you \nREALLY believe in that religion yourself and find that it arouses a deep, strong, genuine response in many \nother people.<p>\n31. (Paragraph 189) Assuming that such a final push occurs. Conceivably the industrial system might be \neliminated in a somewhat gradual or piecemeal fashion (see paragraphs 4, 167 and Note 4).<p>\n32. (Paragraph 193) It is even conceivable (remotely) that the revolution might consist only of a massive \nchange of attitudes toward technology resulting in a relatively gradual and painless disintegration of the \nindustrial system. But if this happens we\u0092ll be very lucky. It\u0092s far more probably that the transition to a \nnontechnological society will be very difficult and full of conflicts and disasters.<p>\n33. (Paragraph 195) The economic and technological structure of a society are far more important than its \npolitical structure in determining the way the average man lives (see paragraphs 95, 119 and Notes 16, \n18).<p>\n34. (Paragraph 215) This statement refers to our particular brand of anarchism. A wide variety of social \nattitudes have been called \u0093anarchist,\u0094 and it may be that many who consider themselves anarchists would \nnot accept our statement of paragraph 215. It should be noted, by the way, that there is a nonviolent \nanarchist movement whose members probably would not accept FC as anarchist and certainly would not \napprove of FC\u0092s violent methods.<p>\n35. (Paragraph 219) Many leftists are motivated also by hostility, but the hostility probably results in part \nfrom a frustrated need for power.<p>\n36. (Paragraph 229) It is important to understand that we mean someone who sympathizes with these \nMOVEMENTS as they exist today in our society. One who believes that women, homosexuals, etc., should \nhave equal rights is not necessary a leftist. The feminist, gay rights, etc., movements that exist in our society \nhave the particular ideological tone that characterizes leftism, and if one believes, for example, that women \nshould have equal rights it does not necessarily follow that one must sympathize with the feminist \nmovement as it exists today.<p>\nIf copyright problems make it impossible for this long quotation to be printed, then please change Note 16 \nto read as follows:<p>\n16. (Paragraph 95) When the American colonies were under British rule there were fewer and less effective \nlegal guarantees of freedom than there were after the American Constitution went into effect, yet there was \nmore personal freedom in pre-industrial America, both before and after the War of Independence, than there \nwas after the Industrial Revolution took hold in this country. In \u0093Violence in America: Historical and \nComparative Perspectives,\u0094 edited by Hugh Davis Graham and Ted Robert Gurr, Chapter 12 by Roger \nLane, it is explained how in pre-industrial America the average person had greater independence and \nautonomy than he does today, and how the process of industrialization necessarily led to the restriction of \npersonal freedom.</font><p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n<center><p>&copy Copyright 1997 The Digital Ink Company<p>\n<font face=\"arial, helvetica\" font size=\"-1\" color=\"#CE0000\">\n<A

fundamentalist and conservative evangelical rhetoric often come across to the American people as hatred rather than the traditional Christian love espoused by Jesus in the New Testament.\u00a0 For this very reason, the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Alabama (one of the most famous and respected civil rights organizations in the United States) has officially defined the Family Research Council as an American hate group because of its intense public rhetoric against gay people.\u00a0 While we do not wish to unfairly paint all Christian fundamentalists and conservative evangelicals as hate mongers, the hate rhetoric that spews forth from many individuals and organizations affiliated with the so-called Religious Right has the power to motivate certain individuals in American society to commit violent acts against ordinary American citizens like you and me.\u00a0 One such incident of domestic terrorism, probably little known nationally and long forgotten by now, occurred on Sunday morning (July 27, 2008) in a church on Kingston Pike in Knoxville, Tennessee.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>On that fateful morning, Jim David Adkisson walked into the sanctuary of the church where 25 children were delivering a play for the 200 congregants sitting in the pews.\u00a0 He was carrying a guitar case containing a shotgun.\u00a0 Mr. Adkisson proceeded to take the shotgun out of the guitar case and began firing at the members of the congregation. Two people were killed and six people were injured. Mr. Adkisson assumed he would be killed in a shootout with police officers from the Knoxville Police Department. Instead, the <em>spineless liberal members</em> (as the rhetoric goes) of the congregation took his gun away, wrestled him to the floor, and subdued him until the police arrived to take control of the situation and make an arrest. As it turned out, Adkisson had in his possession a goodly amount of ammunition and could have killed many more people than he did.\u00a0 </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>In his motor vehicle, the policemen found a long suicide note that the American news media quickly renamed and published as <em>The Adkisson Manifesto</em>. Later in the investigation, when Adkisson&#8217;s home was searched, police officers found an array of typical American conservative propaganda items (presumably books, pamphlets, etc.) that were believed to have worked in combination with his difficult social circumstances to motivate this sad crime.\u00a0 </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>The influence of such literature on Mr. Adkisson was clear in the text of <em>The Adkisson Manifesto</em>.\u00a0 Although the manifesto was written by hand, I used a published newspaper photograph of it in 2008 to make a typed and slightly edited (grammar and punctuation) copy for future reference.\u00a0 I have provided that copy to you below.\u00a0 A careful reading of this document will show you the direct effects of Christian fundamentalist and conservative evangelical anti-LGBTQ hate rhetoric on the actions of Mr. Adkisson.\u00a0 It also shows how racism against black people and other types of rhetoric from conservative extremists influenced this manifesto and the crime. Jim David Adkisson was eventually tried for his crime and sentenced to life in prison without chance of parole. </strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Hold onto your hats because the hate rhetoric in this manifesto is just plain crazy and more than a little scary:</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">The Adkisson Manifesto</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">To Whom It May Concern</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I guess you are wondering why I committed this patriotic act against the Unitarian Universalist Church in Knoxville, Tennessee. Let me explain it in detail here. Over the years I have had some good jobs, but I always got laid off. I am now 58 years old and cannot find a decent job. They tell me I am \u201coverqualified,\u201d which is a code term for \u201ctoo damned old.\u201d I guess they just expect me to age gracefully into poverty. No thank you! My life is done.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I have always wondered why I was put on this Earth. For years, I thought it was so I could die as cannon fodder in Viet-Nam, but I somehow cheated the devil out of that plan. Lately, I have been feeling helpless about our War on Terrorism, but I finally realized that I could engage the terrorist\u2019s allies here in America. These are the best allies they have. The Democrats!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The Democrats have done everything they can to tie our hands in this War on Terror. They are all a bunch of traitors. They want America to lose this war and for reasons I cannot understand. It makes me so exceedingly angry!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In a parallel train of thought, it saddens me to think back on all the bad things that liberalism has done to this country. The worst problem America faces today is liberalism. The liberals have dumbed down education and redefined deviancy as a virtue. Liberals have attacked every major institution that has made America great. The scope of these attacks has ranged from the Boy Scouts of America to the U.S. military and from education to religion. The major news outlets have become the propaganda arm of the Democrat Party. Liberals are evil. They embrace the tenets of Karl Marx. They are Marxist, socialist, and communist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>The Unitarian Universalist Church</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Do not let the word \u201cchurch\u201d mislead you. The Unitarian Universalist Church is not a church. It is a cult. They do not even believe in God. They worship the god of secularism. These sick people are not just liberals. They are ultra-liberals. This is a collection of sick, weird, and homosexual people. The Unitarian Universalist Church is the fountainhead, the veritable wellspring, of anti-American organizations like Moveon.org, and Code Pink. Their people are absolute hypocrites. They embrace every pervert that comes down the pike, but if they discover you are a conservative, they absolutely hate you. I have experienced this first hand in my own life. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why these people would embrace Marxism as they do. I believe someone should do a journalistic expos\u00e9 on this church because it is a den of unAmerican vipers. They call themselves \u201cprogressive.\u201d How is a white woman having a nigger baby progress? How is a man sticking his dick up another man\u2019s ass progress? It is an abomination before the Lord. It takes warped minds to hate America like they do. It makes me so angry! I cannot live with it anymore! The environmental nuts have to be stopped too!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Know This if Nothing Else</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>I. This Was a Hate Crime:</strong> I hate the damned left-wing liberals. There is a vast left-wing conspiracy in this country, and these liberals are working together to attack every decent and honorable institution in our nation. They are trying to turn this country into a communist state. Shame on them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>II. This Was a Political Protest:</strong> I am protesting the liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices for giving constitutional rights to the terrorists at Gitmo. I am protesting the major news outlets (ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and PBS) for being the propaganda wing of the Democrat Party. The things they are getting away with are criminal. They are traitors! They must be stopped. I am protesting against the Democratic National Convention for running a radical, leftist candidate for President of the United States, namely Osama Hussein Obama (Yo Mama!!!). He has no experience. He has no brains. He is a joke. He is dangerous to America. Hell! He even looks like Curious George!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>III. This Was a Symbolic Killing:</strong> I wanted to kill every Democrat in the U.S. Senate, every Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives, and all 100 people in Bernard Goldberg\u2019s book entitled <em>100 People Who Are Screwing Up America</em>. I would like to kill everyone in the mainstream news media. Nonetheless, I knew these people were inaccessible to me. I could not get to the generals and high-ranking officers of the Marxist movement, so I went after the foot soldiers, the chicken shit liberals who vote these traitorous people into office. Someone had to get the ball rolling. I volunteered. I hope others will do the same. It is the only way we can rid America of this cancer and pestilence called liberalism!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">No one gets out of this world alive, so I have chosen to skip my oncoming bad years of poverty. I know my life is going downhill fast from here. The future looks bleak. I am just sick and tired of being sick and tired. I am absolutely fed up.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So, I decided to do something good for this country. Kill Democrats until the cops kill me. If each decent and patriotic American could vote three times in every election, we still could not stem this tide of liberalism that is destroying America. Liberals are a pest like termites. There are millions of them. Each little bite they take contributes to the downfall of this great nation. The only way we can rid ourselves of this evil is to kill them in the streets. Kill them where they gather!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I would like to encourage other like-minded people to do as I have done. If life is no longer worth living, do not just kill yourself. Do something worthwhile for your country before you go. Kill liberals.</p>\n<p>Tell this to the cop who killed me, \u201cThanks, I needed that!\u201d</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I have no next of kin and no living relatives. If you would like to do so, please take my sorry carcass to the The Body Farm at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, donate it to science, or just throw it in the Tennessee River.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jim David Adkisson</p>\n<div id=\"atatags-370373-5c004c0637df7\">\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n            __ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n                __ATA.initVideoSlot('atatags-370373-5c004c0637df7', {\n                    sectionId: '370373',\n                    format: 'inread'\n                });\n            });\n        </script>\n    </div>\t\t<div class=\"wpcnt\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wpa wpmrec\">\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"wpa-about\">Advertisements</span>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"u\">\t\t<div style=\"padding-bottom:15px;width:300px;height:250px;float:left;margin-right:5px;margin-top:0px\">\n\t\t<div id=\"atatags-26942-5c004c0637e33\">\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.initSlot('atatags-26942-5c004c0637e33',  {\n\t\t\t\t\tcollapseEmpty: 'before',\n\t\t\t\t\tsectionId: '26942',\n\t\t\t\t\twidth: 300,\n\t\t\t\t\theight: 250\n\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t</script>\n\t\t</div></div>\t\t<div style=\"padding-bottom:15px;width:300px;height:250px;float:left;margin-top:0px\">\n\t\t<div id=\"atatags-114160-5c004c0637e35\">\n\t\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.initSlot('atatags-114160-5c004c0637e35',  {\n\t\t\t\t\tcollapseEmpty: 'before',\n\t\t\t\t\tsectionId: '114160',\n\t\t\t\t\twidth: 300,\n\t\t\t\t\theight: 250\n\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t</script>\n\t\t</div></div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div><div id=\"jp-post-flair\" class=\"sharedaddy sd-like-enabled sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-213\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://faith17983.wordpress.com/2015/05/31/the-adkisson-manifesto/?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-213\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://faith17983.wordpress.com/2015/05/31/the-adkisson-manifesto/?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=\"share-google-plus-1\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-google-213\" class=\"share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://faith17983.wordpress.com/2015/05/31/the-adkisson-manifesto/?share=google-plus-1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Google+\"><span>Google</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div><div class='sharedaddy sd-block sd-like jetpack-likes-widget-wrapper jetpack-likes-widget-unloaded' id='like-post-wrapper-91170039-213-5c004c063aab9' data-src='//widgets.wp.com/likes/index.html?ver=20180319#blog_id=91170039&amp;post_id=213&amp;origin=faith17983.wordpress.com&amp;obj_id=91170039-213-5c004c063aab9' data-name='like-post-frame-91170039-213-5c004c063aab9'><h3 class='sd-title'>Like this:</h3><div class='likes-widget-placeholder post-likes-widget-placeholder' style='height: 55px;'><span class='button'><span>Like</span></span> <span class=\"loading\">Loading...</span></div><span class='sd-text-color'></span><a class='sd-link-color'></a></div></div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"entry-utility\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis entry was posted in <a href=\"https://faith17983.wordpress.com/category/uncategorized/\" rel=\"category tag\">Uncategorized</a>.
